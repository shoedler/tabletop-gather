In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order&#10;&#10;In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.&#10;&#10;Players begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.&#10;&#10;A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3.

Every element of open wheel racing is covered from qualifying right down to the checkered flag.&#10;&#10;In Fast Lane racing, drivers are rated separately for qualifying and racing, giving you an extremely accurate picture of each and every driver to get behind the wheel in the 2008 season.  To further enhance the realism, each driver is rated for the various track types run in the open wheel series.  Drivers are also rated for their ability to lead laps, how they perform during pit stops, and tendency to avoid mechanical failures.  You truly get an accurate representation of each driver.&#10;&#10;All tracks are individually rated as well.  Each track is rated for Pole Position Speed, number of caution flags, Racing Speed, and weather.&#10;&#10;Speaking of weather; how many times have you watched a race and heard the drivers and commentators talk about how the track has changed due to weather?  In Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve replicated this most important facet of racing.  You&rsquo;ll see the effects of a green track following heavy rains.  You&rsquo;ll see drivers run faster laps at Indianapolis as the track closes and the track cools.&#10;&#10;And speaking of Indianapolis, we have replicated EVERY facet of the unique qualifying format of the world&rsquo;s most famous race, right down to the bumping into the field!&#10;&#10;Fast Lane Racing is not a quick play game.  However, we&rsquo;ve compressed the racing into the most exciting elements, giving you a game that plays quickly.  With Fast Lane Racing, you&rsquo;ll be able to realistically complete an entire season.  A typical race and qualifying session takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes total.  If you use actual qualifiers and only run the races, you&rsquo;ll consistently finish within 20 minutes.  And while we have compressed the racing, we have not cut corners.  You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; every detail of the race unfold right on your tabletop!&#10;&#10;Each Fast Lane Racing Year Book contains everything you need to play.  There are no external &ldquo;game parts&rdquo; to buy.&#10;&#10;The printed games feature individual, die-cut driver and track cards, with everything packed in a sturdy game box.&quot;&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 33, '', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

It consistently ranks among the greatest films of all time; in 2007 it ranked at #34 in a list of 100 and was the only animated film in the list. In 1989 the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; Like other Disney projects, spin-off marketing soon created related merchandise. Products introduced in 1937 included &quot;The Game of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; from Milton Bradley Company. A complicated game with several different playing pieces and multiple types of rules, the game attempts to mimic the plot of the movie.

The rules mostly detail scoring for the various hands that can be formed.&#10;&#10;In this game, players try to combine twelve cards in three sets of four cards, each set belonging to one of the three classes allowed. To do this, players can choose to take a face-up card from the draw pile or a face-down card from the discard pile. A set of the Class 1 type consists of four cards of the same suit. For Class 2 sets, each four cards should be arranged as two pairs, with the sum of the values being 9 (e.g., 2, 2 and 7, 7). Class 3 is about making groups of four cards of the same number (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 2). In each Class, some cards combinations are considered weak, easy or strong, giving 2, 4 or 8 points, respectively. Moreover, there are several conditions and card combinations that add doubling factors progressively to the total sum. In this way, one doubling multiplies the points by a factor of 2, two by 4, three by 8, etc. The game lasts several rounds until a player reaches a predetermined amount of points.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/amJJzNEGc5nZ548zxZIHcw__original/img/H1mQItqudSUiKehmqIs3O9LlQdo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic491567.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

At the end of a long line of communication back to Paris, the Grande Arm&eacute;e feigns weakness in the cold and fog of an early December morning in 1805. Now Austerlitz 20 presents the story of desperation and destiny as three Emperors clash to resolve the fate of Europe. With its myriad scenarios and variations, students of history can explore a plethora of &quot;What if?&quot; possibilities as Allied greatness clashes with French glory at the dawn of the &quot;Sun of Austerlitz.&quot;&#10;&#10;This game features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &quot;friction of war&quot; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 corps or division, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).&#10;&#10;2009 Charles S.

This game can be played by 2 or more Players and can either be played as one off single combats or as it is intended as Tournaments, where your Gladiator Characters battle for their lives, with heavily wounded victors being retired or succumbing to their wounds after the combat, and your victorious Gladiators battling to become champions and win you more money and infamy.&#10;&#10;The basis of the game, is that you take on the role of a Lanista (proprietor of a Troop of Gladiators), with the sole aim of making as much money as you can out of the spilling of blood in the arena. Each Player starts with 1000 Denarii, (metal coins supplied with the game), this money is then used to buy the Gladiators that you start the first round with, and for placing side bets before each fight begins. Hopefully as you win your fights, you will increase your wealth, and be able to replenish your killed fighters with new ones, maybe even Essedarius chariots or Equites.&#10;&#10;The game has a quick and brutal feel about it, with limbs being hacked off and savage Special Moves that can be used by your Champions. Many combats can be played in only 10 minutes, though more skilled Gladiators, or larger battles may take up to 1 hour. There are rules for Chariots, Horsemen, Wild Beasts, Unusual types of Gladiators as well as for the more common types, such as the Retiarius and the Veles and the Myrmillo.&#10;&#10;The combats take place on a specially designed sandy coloured Arena Playing Area (supplied with the game). This is marked out with Hexes and a special mechanism for Chariot movements. The use of Hexes makes the movement and attacks on the flanks quick and easy to work out. The Arena Playing Area also has Number and Dropped Weapon markers, which can be helpful in larger battles when it can be hard to remember what order players fight in.&#10;&#10;To sum up, I wanted this game to be fast and simple to play. This was difficult to do due to the numerous vastly different fighting methods, but I am very pleased with the results. The game bag contains all the things that you will need to play the game except the miniatures. The rule book has a ghostly sepia colour cover and has diagrams to help explain the harder rules. This game will bring out the tactician in you, as tactics play a vital part as the rounds progress. The more you play the faster it becomes and the more you will find that you have learnt since the last time you played it. So, if you fancy your chances in the sands of the colloseum, try it out!&#10;&#10;&ndash;Description from publisher / designer&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 0, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hIdxatJiB_oXdYGLH8-Edw__original/img/WPAJi_qeZCSHPTBerYmzuT9pgAU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic495910.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The units of the IDF 401st Brigade had been waiting for weeks for orders as they sat taking incoming Hezbollah attacks. Orders had come in twice to proceed and twice were cancelled. The canyon like Saluki is a &quot;gateway to the Litani river&quot;, an essential objective in southern Lebanon assigned to the brigade before the cease-fire went into action. On August 11, just before 1500 hours, orders came in, but at this late stage, made no sense to the brigade staff. Crossing the Saluki meant the troops and tanks had to climb a steep hill while exposed to attack from mountains on every side. Understanding the risk to tanks, Division 162 deployed its Nahal Brigade infantry on the high ground outside the villages Ghandouriya and Farun, to provide cover for the armored column advancing below. The distance from one plateau to another across the steep valley is only a half mile. Both towns that the IDF attempted to screen were still in enemy hands and both a good half mile from the edge of the Saluki Valley. Russian-made AT- 14 Kornet anti-tank missiles waited en-masse in excellent firing positions. IDF tanks would attempt to climb along a narrow dirt track just below this area!

The Bastiano army counter-attacked in June of 1958, driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the Guerrillas in their mountain strongholds, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the Guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano Western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Fulgencia Batista fled in January of 1959, the Guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was officially free.

At that time, as his forces are completing the conquest of Poland, Hitler receives a flash of intuition. That is, he can&rsquo;t help but notice the strategic paralysis of the Anglo-French, who do nothing to try to prevent the downfall of their fast-disappearing eastern ally Poland. From that he concludes it would be a waste of time to redeploy the Wehrmacht to the western front in 1940. He tells his generals: &ldquo;The time will never be better to destroy the Bolshevik power than in the coming year. We will continue to have nothing to fear in the west. The British and French simply do not want war; they are afraid of it. Once we&rsquo;ve taken Moscow, we&rsquo;ll take Paris and London by telephone.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Accordingly, he also tells his foreign minister to drop all negotiations aimed at revising the original territorial split set out in the accords with the USSR the previous month. Most importantly, Lithuania, originally in the German &ldquo;sphere of interest,&rdquo; is not traded for a further slice of Polish territory.&#10;&#10;All of which has resulted in this low-complexity, strategic-level, alternative history wargame. In it, two to four players can investigate the possibilities inherent in a changed German strategy for 1940. The West Front map is scaled at 16 miles per hexagon. The Eastern Front map is scaled at 25 miles per hex. All Soviet units are armies; all other forces in the game are corps. Each game turn on both maps equals half a month.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by two, three or four. If two play, one commands the Germans, while the other commands both the Anglo-French and Soviets. If played by three, one player commands the Germans, one player commands the Anglo-French, and the third commands the Soviets. If four play, one player commands the Germans on the west map; the second commands the Germans on the east map; the third commands the Soviets, and the fourth commands the Anglo-French.

Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare.

If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.&#10;&#10;The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.&#10;&#10;A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks.

There's shipping by sea as well, which works a tiny little bit differently.&#10;&#10;The players, rich merchants, decide which shipping company invests where and how. They do this by buying cubes of the color of that shipping company. The cubes bought can be put on the map as sections of trade roads (or harbors), or they can be kept in the player's stock as 'influence' in that shipping company. The profits of a shipping company are divided by ratio of such influence cubes. Hence, owning more cubes means a larger share of the profit. However, a shipping company can only make a profit if it has many trade roads, many cubes on the map. Therefore, cube hoarders get a large share of nothing, and a player that spends all his cubes on roads gets a tiny share or even nothing of - potentially - a lot.&#10;&#10;Of course, the profit a shipping company makes is entirely dependent on whether the roads (and harbors) of that company are actually used. Players decide what to ship from what location to what other location. Of course, the choice is driven by profit maximization.&#10;There are 10 locations on the map. 7 of these are Chinese cities. The other 3 are foreign locations. In all locations, three (out of five total) goods are traded. Prices are set randomly at the beginning of the game, but after that they depend on trade. Buying goods in a market makes the price of that good increase. Selling goods in a market makes the price of that good decrease.&#10;&#10;And, rather importantly, all players (secretly) plan their trades at the same time.

Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a threat to General Sherman's vulnerable and strung out supply line during his Georgia March to the Sea in 1864.&#10; A detachment of 8000 Union soldiers, a mix of cavalry &amp; infantry, were sent to eliminate Forrest's troops.&#10; The over eager young Union officer, Samuel Sturgis, sent his cavalry over 7 miles in front of his infantry.&#10; Forrest predicted the battle's outcome early that day to one of his generals. He stated that their Confederate cavalry would drive the Union cavalry back in a rout and push them into the tired Union infantry slogging their way towards the battlefield. His prediction was true as the Union cavalry quickly broke and retreated right back into the confused infantry. The infantry could not organize a stand in the panicked retreat of the horsemen. The Union troops were routed and suffered casualties that exceed the CSA losses by 3 to 1.&#10; In the end though, Forrest was not able to interfere with the supply line of Sherman's army, so in this, Sherman's goal was accomplished.&#10; This game comes with 2 scenarios, the simplified rules, 2 maps (in four pieces), counter images and needed charts.

Now, players of The Red Dragon Inn, The Red Dragon Inn 2, The Red Dragon Inn 3, and The Red Dragon Inn 4 can play out an actual round of gambling when they play the &quot;Gambling? I'm In!&quot; card! Even better, the gambling games also can be played on their own as standalone games, or as part of your RPG, or LARP. The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.&#10;&#10;This card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).&#10;&#10;There are five base games included and are as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.&#10;     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. &#10;     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.&#10;     Den of Thieves - No dice. Hands are dealt and players use the special abilities of each character to influence hand weight and scoring.&#10;     The Wheel (and The Clock) - No dice. Players try to guess what cards others are collecting in order to gain points and win the round.&#10;&#10;&#10;When combined with The Red Dragon games, when a player plays the &quot;Gambling, I'm in!&quot; card, the player may decide to choose any game from the list to play instead of the normal gambling rules.

The map encompasses the entire theater of war from the English Channel to the Swiss Border. The game system used is a streamlined derivative of the 1914, Twilight in the East system, modified to speed play, with care not to lose focus on those aspects of warfare that made the opening stages of WWI so unique. This game system, in conjunction with the accurate map, allows the German advance to be conducted along historical routes with the eminent &ldquo;Open Flank&rdquo; present (instead of units strung out from map edge to map edge). The Allied player has an opportunity to recreate a &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; type victory or to stop the Germans earlier. Likewise, the German player has a chance to change history and defeat the Allies&rsquo; armies in 1914.&#10;&#10;The Grand Campaign scenario covers the period from the fall of Liege on August 16th to exhaustion at Ypres in mid-November. Two shorter scenarios, The Battle for Lorraine (a learning scenario) and From the Marne to Stalemate are also provided.&#10;&#10;1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a playable &ldquo;Monster Game&rdquo; designed with the expressed goal that the majority of the game can be completed by four dedicated players in one five-day long Expo. The 24-page rules booklet is concise, well written and organized. The game is exciting and gives wonderful insights into one of the most important campaigns of the twentieth century. The result is that 1914, Offensive &agrave; outrance is a game that the &ldquo;WW1 enthusiast&rdquo; must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.&#10;&#10;Time Scale: Game turns vary between two and four days in length.&#10;Map Scale: Eight kilometers per hex.&#10;Unit Scale: Division/Brigade.&#10;Number of Players: one to many (well suited for four players).&#10;&#10;Game Designer: Michael Resch&#10;Research and Design Assistance: Rian van Meeteren&#10;Developed by: Dick Vohlers&#10;Map Design Assistance: S.

Will you use the transit station to move another player&rsquo;s military base out of the way, or place your embassy to steal his temple? Will you try for a greater area under your control, or move to capture key buildings?&#10;&#10;Infinite City is a standalone tile game in which players become the leaders of corporations building an ever-sprawling city, maneuvering to control the largest districts while holding on to the most valuable buildings.&#10;&#10;Infinite City uses tiles to represent buildings, and colored pegs to represent control by players.  The tiles are mixed, five tiles are dealt to each player, and five tiles are placed face down in the shape of a cross at the center of the play area.  On their turns, players play a tile face up adjacent to one of the five starting tiles or a previously played tile, play one of their colored pegs on the tile, and follow the instructions on the tile.  These instructions may lead to playing additional tiles, drawing tiles, moving tiles previously played, turning face down tiles face up, taking tiles from opponents, preventing actions or even exchanging hands of tiles with other players.  When players finish their turns, if they have less than five tiles in their hands, they draw additional tiles so that they end their turn with at least five tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player places the last of his colored pegs, or the fifth Power Station tile is played.  Each player is awarded points for contiguous groups of at least three tiles controlled by him at a rate of one point per tile.  Some tiles have a point value number in the corner; players receive the number of points indicated for such tiles that they control.  Also, some tiles have silver rings; the player controlling the most of these receives one point per such tile.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WZm0CwzdtC2fGIg4DlDJPQ__original/img/r3IrqF1USxEgpXIjYKKKmnBGUlM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic511277.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

It is designed for 3-6 players, but there is a 2-player variant, and the rules are such that someone who has played it can explain it quickly to new players.&#10;&#10;soft landing is a trade and resource management game, but the trick is, different players are going to be trying to end the game different ways, and everyone has a different starting score. The European Union has good production numbers, but only starts with 3VP. Africa, not so good on production, starts with 12VP, and there are regions that start with up to 17VP. Obviously, Africa wants the game to end sooner, while it is still ahead, and may try to force Catastrophes. The EU wants the game to last longer so it can develop New Era tech, and will be trying to abate Catastrophes.&#10;&#10;You need to provide for the needs of your people, and if you do not, you generate &quot;stress&quot;, which accumulates in a central location. The type of stress depends on your nation.&#10;&#10;For instance, on a production roll of &quot;5&quot;, Africa generates one Tech, one Industry and one Resources. If it does not acquire some Reserves or Lifestyle by the end of the turn, it will generate (from left to right, Political stress, Health stress and Population stress (fyi, the panda is Environmental stress). Each of these stresses has a little holding area on the score track where all the tokens accumulate until bad things happen...&#10;&#10;Each nation also can use its production to buy special abilities, which are generally what you use to mess with other players. For instance, Africa has good production numbers for &quot;Resources&quot; and might have a surplus, but need &quot;Industry&quot;. Another player might have Market Manipulation, and use it to drive the &quot;sell&quot; price for Resources down to zero, screwing over Africa. Or, a nation with a Military could take existing stress tokens and rearrange them. When enough stress builds up, bad things happen (minor or major Catastrophes), and whoever has the most of their tokens in that zone takes the blame (and loses VP). Your Military is not actually attacking another player, you're just taking existing global stress and shifting it around to get yourself out of a jam, blame someone else, or both. Your turn consists of production, using abilities, trade, stress and investment, each of which is a very simple action, so turns move pretty quick.&#10;&#10;soft landing has some superficial strategies and some more subtle ones. If you play looking only out for yourself, odds are that someone else will pass you by limited cooperation with another player.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UG0hGsVjPz1NxSqNm5__kg__original/img/f-Q5Bp9-W2BU1nrDXMs-HYhYIFI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic510221.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The first person to return to the Garden with Mystery Cards spelling &quot;TOWER&quot; and has a turret token from each of the four turrets, wins the game!&#10;&#10;When playing The Tower of Mystery, you win by constantly adjusting your game-play based on unexpected events.  No matter how masterful you think your plan for winning the game is, it WILL be up-ended by your opponents, and the crazy events that occur within the tower. Your goal is to keep moving towards achieving the game objectives as best you can!  During the game, players move around the seven levels, up and down staircases, and into the four turrets, landing on board spaces where &quot;things happen&quot;. Sometimes a player may get money or lose money, get or lose Mystery Cards, may get to roll the dice and see what happens, might have the chance to swap the location of their playing piece with another player's piece, steal cards or money from other players, or any of many different scenarios and possibilities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the &quot;TOWER&quot; Mystery Cards, there are Mystery Cards that allow you to do nice things to yourself, or try to stop your opponents.  There are several ways to collect Mystery Cards. Some ways are free, others cost money. The fastest but most risky way to collect free Mystery Cards is to stay in a turrent for multiple turns. However, while in a turret, a player is vulnerable because they cannot play any Mystery Cards. Players can collect up to 3 free Mystery Cards per turn while in a turret so even though it's risky to stay in a turret for very long, there's definitely a benefit to visiting the turrets even though playing Mystery Cards there is a no-no.&#10;&#10;Players can play any number of Mystery Cards on any other players (or themselves) even when it's not their turn! This can cause &quot;mayhem&quot; when several players suddenly jump into the action at the same time!  You will have to alter your plans over and over in order to stay ahead of your opponents!  Almost constant player interaction keeps everyone on their toes, all the while laughing and having fun every step of the way!&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn that a player's piece is in a turret, they must draw a Turret Card. Turret Cards might affect only the player drawing the card, might affect everyone in the game, or several players but not all.  One thing is for sure: Turret Cards often dramatically change the game for everyone in an instant! Some Turret Cards are helpful, but most of them cause unexpected, often funny events to happen to some or all of the players in the game!&#10;&#10;While money is a component of the game, it has no bearing on winning the game! Tower Bucks are used to buy Mystery Cards and pay penalties. Being broke is risky, because if a player is completely broke and they have to pay a fine to the bank or a penalty to another player, they lose three turns!  Hoarding money serves no purpose, however, so each player has to decide how much money is enough to keep and how much is safe to spend.&#10;&#10;The Tower of Mystery is a great Party Game for all ages! Adults young and old enjoy playing The Tower of Mystery when together for their regular social Game Night. Families enjoy it for Family Game Night because it's equally playable for both the kids and the parents. It is suitable for children as young as about eight as long as they are able to read the cards and know the best time to play their cards. Teens enjoy The Tower of Mystery because it's so unpredictable and lively.  Even retired yacht club ladies have been known to give up their Friday afternoon dominoes to play The Tower of Mystery!  If you enjoy great player interaction, surprises, laughter and fun, then the Tower of Mystery is the game for you!&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 8, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XZP8M6w63wAscDOeXVJvcA__original/img/5NxRm6rg7rXNdtoBY0qyjAu9G0s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic512194.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.&#10;&#10;Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.&#10;&#10;Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is &quot;burned.&quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:&#10;&#10;* 1 Rulebook&#10;    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions&#10;    * 4 Capital Boards&#10;    * 35 Resource Tokens&#10;    * 60 Damage Tokens&#10;    * 4 Burning Tokens&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Battle Pack Expansion Cycles:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        &#10;1) The Corruption Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Skavenblight Threat&#10;    Path of the Zealot&#10;    Tooth and Claw&#10;    The Deathmaster's Dance&#10;    The Warpstone Chronicles&#10;    Arcane Fire&#10;&#10;&#10;2) The Enemy Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Burning of Derricksburg&#10;    The Fall of Karak Grimaz&#10;    The Silent Forge&#10;    Redemption of a Mage&#10;    The Fourth Waystone&#10;    Bleeding Sun&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;3) The Morrslieb Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Omens of Ruin&#10;    The Chaos Moon&#10;    The Twin Tailed Comet&#10;    Signs in the Stars&#10;    The Eclipse of Hope&#10;    Fiery Dawn&#10;&#10;&#10;4) The Capital Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Inevitable City&#10;    Realm of the Phoenix King&#10;    The Iron Rock&#10;    Karaz-a-Karak&#10;    City of Winter&#10;    The Imperial Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;5) The Bloodquest Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Rising Dawn&#10;    Fragments of Power&#10;    The Accursed Dead&#10;    Vessel of the Winds&#10;    Portent of Doom&#10;    Shield of the Gods&#10;&#10;&#10;6) The Eternal War Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Days of Blood&#10;    Oaths of Vengeance&#10;    Battle for the Old World&#10;    Glory of Days Past&#10;    The Ruinous Hordes&#10;    Faith and Steel          &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;7) Deluxe Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Assault on Ulthuan&#10;    March of the Damned&#10;    Legends&#10;    Cataclysm&#10;    Hidden Kingdoms&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FoX0oahWOeBmGrOlsbd0dg__original/img/nEwvMGXdw4Jgby6v2maogzZemmI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic567135.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The bowler picks 6 random cards for the balls in the over, which he can play in any order. The batsman has a number of batting cards which varies according to which number he is batting at. The bowler plays a card (a ball) and the batsman plays a card against that ball. If the batting card is a valid stoke for that ball (a cover drive for a half volley outside off stump, a sweep to a googly, etc), then the outcome is as printed on the batting card sometimes runs, but often just fielded. If the batting card is not a valid stroke for the ball bowled, then the batsman is likely to be out (there are appeals and not outs using the die). If he is not out, the batsman replenishes his hand, and the next ball is bowled.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_TslldFsLH7Y8VkkpPme3g__original/img/njbJkGlLME8SQXhdkw_VPFymrJY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic515676.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

ANY time is &quot;football season&quot; when you've got a copy of COLD SNAP on your game shelf! YOU call the plays, YOU set the defensive alignments, YOU decide who to bring in when a star player goes down with an injury. Think you can do a better job with your favorite Canadian pro team than the real-life coach did? Well, now you can find OUT! (HINT: you might just gain a new respect for the real-life coach!)&#10;&#10;Recent years have seen a glut of new football games hit the market. Many of them are very good. But two key differences make COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game stand out above the crowd of pro football simulation board games...&#10;&#10;FIRST, this is a pro football game where EVERY player on the field matters. In many other games, defenders and linemen are treated almost as an afterthought--some games don't even rate them at ALL! But in COLD SNAP, the success or failure of a play most often HINGES on the performance of these players! Yes, the star Canadian passers and runners will stand out on your table-top--but so will the star interior linemen, linebackers and defensive backs! It's exciting to watch!&#10;&#10;SECOND, the COLD SNAP results book is cleverly designed to tell you not only WHAT happens on every play, but also WHY! Other games might tell you, for example, that the quarterback just threw an incomplete pass--and that's all the information you get. However, the COLD SNAP results book will tell you whether the incompletion was the result of great coverage by a defensive back, a hurried throw thanks to a missed block by an offensive lineman, a wrong pass route run by the receiver, or any of a multitude of other possible reasons! You'll know what DID happen, AND what MIGHT have happened, if not for the play made or NOT made. It's just like watching pro football on TV, with the game book serving as your color commentator!&#10;&#10;COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game is incredibly detailed, yet easy to play. The offense coach chooses a ball carrier or intended receiver for one of six basic offense plays, while the defense coach secretly decides on one of four basic color-coded defense settings. (You can play solitaire, too--there are rules included for that!) Roll the dice, look up the result in the game book, record the gain or loss, and move on to the next play! It's that simple!&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rvgKnpjh6DoJK6f_c9JYGw__original/img/mWr32mSL1HX3zZU1YvXpLQNm3Tk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6952721.png', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

This is the original version of the game, which went through several iterations before ultimately appearing as a boxed game as Railway Rivals and Dampfross. It was designed by David Watts, a Welsh geography teacher and train buff.&#10;&#10;It was always intended first and foremost to be a good game to play, but David also wanted to use it for general education &ndash; explaining why railway lines were laid where they were, etc. The game is fundamentally straightforward &ndash; players build railway lines on a map (a tesselation of hexagons) with towns, rivers, hills, coastlines, etc. After a building phase there is then a racing phase &ndash; players race between randomly generated combinations of towns. Players with the most extensive efficient networks tend to win more races, and thus the game.&#10;&#10;It always existed as 'just' a set of rules, with a number of official or unofficial maps available from various sources. The earliest and crudest manifestation was just a few (5 or 6) A4 hexagon sheets, and colouring instructions to make the maps up. When postal games players showed considerable enthusiasm for the game, David moved on to produce large size (slightly bigger than A2) hexagon sheets, also with colouring instructions. Later on the maps were printed in one colour on big maps, which you could colour highlight yourself, and cover with sticky-back plastic sheets, so that maps could be reused if water-based pens were used that could be washed off. Multicolour maps followed, which were later printed with a laminate covering.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are very simple, and there is some luck involved with the random races that appear, and in racing. Nevertheless, the better players nearly always come out on top. Despite the apparent simplicity, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughtful play, especially with tactics such as blocking other players out of areas of the map.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 8, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sIr4Q01yLFU9bM6mkvH30A__original/img/xyYN9ASnu-Nrwc0jk-tPQYUlWWA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic516439.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

On a turn, a player moves one or more of his figures based on the roll of the die, splitting up the movement points as desired; alternatively, a player can select an officer or general before rolling, thereby allowing him to move that figure (and no others) twice or three times the number rolled.&#10;&#10;If a player&rsquo;s figure lands adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s, the players each roll a die to see which figure is sent to the sidelines, with officers receiving a +2 battle bonus and generals receiving +3. By reaching promotion zones on the board, you can upgrade figures by one rank, making them more powerful in battle.&#10;&#10;Permanent and temporary safety zones provide some cover as you move figures around the board. Your goal is to break through the wall surrounding the opponent&rsquo;s compound, whether by assulting the wall directly or using special demolition spaces, then occupy his bunker, scoring points for doing so.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yNSYg44JLmtD1gpz_o4sOw__original/img/gMzVg1-lO_eBf31obhUFEMzAh-4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic527176.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

A game for any number of players.&#10;Each player in turn throws the five dice. The score is noted but a 2 or a 5 score zero points and the offending die is removed. The player throws again with the number of dice that didn't score 2 or 5. This score is added to his first throw. This process continues until finally the player throws 2 or 5 with his remaining di(c)e, thus losing them and ending his throw. His final tally is recorded and the 5 dice are given to the next player to construct his score. The winner is the person who scored the highest total in a set number of turns or predetermined time.&#10;&#10;Yankee Grab: A game for 3 or 4 players using 3 dice.&#10;Each player in turn throws the three dice. The highest of these is set aside, and the player rolls the two remaining dice. The highest of these is set aside again. These two numbers are totalled and then multiplied by the last dice after it has been thrown again. The score is noted and the next player has his three throws.&#10;The player with the highest score wins the round. It is traditional to play 10 rounds with the winner having won the majority of rounds.&#10;&#10;5000: A game for any number of players using 6 dice.&#10;The object of the game is to accumulate 5000 points. The dice score as follows:&#10;Any 5 scores 50 points&#10;Any 1 scores 100 points&#10;Three 2's score 200&#10;Straight 1 to 6 scores 1500&#10;6 of a kind = instant win 5000 points&#10;Three 5's score 500 points&#10;Three 6's score 600 points&#10;Three 1's score 1000 points&#10;3 pairs score 500 points&#10;&#10;To play: The 1st player throws the 6 dice. The dice which score are set to one side and the remaining dice can be thrown again. Scoring dice are again put to one side. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. A player does not have to put aside all scoring dice if he does not wish. In each turn a player must score at least 350. This is called the BASE SCORE. After the base score is reached the player has the option to STICK or continue throwing. If he sticks the points scored in that turn are noted and play passes to the next player. With each throw of the dice at least one die must score and increase the point count of that turn or the whole score for that turn is lost, and play passes to the next player. If all 6 dice score and have been placed to one side, all six may be thrown again. One can continue as long as the score is improved with each throw.&#10;When a player has stuck or lost his turn, the dice pass to the next player, who must either score 'base' ot at least 50 points more than the previous player's score for that turn, whichever is greatest. Failure to do so means that the score for that round is lost.&#10;&#10;Rotation: A game for any number of players using 2 dice.&#10;The possible totals that two dice can make are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.&#10;There are 11 rounds to this game - one for each total. In teh first round the players each try and score a total of 2. If he suceeds 2 is added to his score. In the second round players try to score a total of 3 etc. E,g. in round 7 when players are trying to achieve a total of 8, a player throws a 5 and a 3. 8 points are therefore added to his score. The person with the highest total after 11 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 0, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Co7W4KEzaETBzLOa2bmvyQ__original/img/YY0666wbtQ_xGmDz9eF7Y7Tp8FQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1518692.png', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The winner is the first to complete his or her column.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a8_chu1zMtvvV6WaRcoJag__original/img/VcHEfSXVtmPpHV8r9O1Otmj2zaU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic985824.png', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Weakened by a decade of humiliation from foreign powers following the Opium War, the Qing Imperial Government is at odds with itself about how to rule the country.  One side argues that China should adopt Western practices and institutions in order to level the playing field abroad.  The opposition claims that China must continue to stand defiant of foreign influence and forge its own path.  At the same time, a failed Confucian scholar in a desolate region of the South has recently proclaimed himself a high place in a foreign religion--the younger brother of Jesus Christ.&#10;&#10;So moved by his visions, he begins gathering followers to act against the government whose Confucian ideals had ranked him so poorly.  The pool he draws from consists not only of those who had been downtrodden and forgotten by the massive and corrupt governmental bureaucracy, but also wealthy families who believe a Han Chinese national could lead their people much better than the foreign Manchu from the North, who had conquered China almost two centuries before.&#10;&#10;This prophet's name? Hong Xiuquan&#10;&#10;His mission?  To expunge the Manchu demon rulers from the Han kingdom and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity on Earth.&#10;&#10;The eventual death toll?  Over 20 million.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Heavenly Kingdom of Greater Peace--Taiping.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Information&#10;&#10;The Scramble for China is a two player war-game set in the most destructive period of the 19th century, the Taiping Rebellion.  You either play as the Taiping, a pseudo-Christian movement that is sweeping South and Central China and wishes to topple the Manchu-run government and create a new culture for China, or the Qing dynasty, an incompetent gigantic imperial administration that is trying to hold the country together and stop the momentum of the Taiping.&#10;&#10;Players progress through the game using cards drawn into their hand; the cards either have an event written on them or a number of Action Points, and players take turns playing cards one at a time.  Action Points allow the players to recruit armies(colored blocks), form up troops into different types of units and attack the enemy.  During the course of the game both players can call upon foreign soldiers to get the edge in battle, and the Taiping will try and meet up with rebels in nearby provinces to add manpower into their army.  Victory goes to whichever side has the most victory points at the end of the game.  Most victory points are earned by holding red city spaces at the end of turn 8, but the Qing player gets bonus points for every city never lost, and the Taiping player for every rebel piece picked up.&#10;&#10;A third Non-Playable faction exists in the game through 'The West'.  'The West' steals points from the Chinese players for every foreign unit on the board at the end of the game, randomly receives points for how much attention it is paying to China through 'The West' deck, and earns points from player card events and Chinese casualties.  It is very possible that both Chinese players will lose and the West triumphs, so Chinese players must be weary in how they utilize foreigners...&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FjxN_2eGJHk5morT8DRCBg__original/img/m5zqxPbvSUMPNM5hBO-Vw6uz-OI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic541043.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Young boys worked as a couriers delivering letters and orders between squads of rebels, running through the underground sewage canals of Warsaw. Many of them died on that duty.&#10;&#10;In &ldquo;Little Insurgents&rdquo; each player takes command of a unit of three Scouts with the goal of delivering the most orders on time. The scouts from different units are racing against each other to be first, but they also have to co-operate. If the order is not delivered on time crucial parts of the city, or even whole districts can be lost to the occupiers. If too many orders fall into hands of the enemy all players lose.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two variants of rules: basic and extended, with basic being easier and involving more random elements. It is suitable for young players and families. The extended variant, dedicated to adults and gamers, involves special actions, more planning and secret goals.&#10;&#10;The game will be published by Egmont Polska in the autumn of 2009 with rules in three languages: Polish, English and German.&#10;&#10;The game was developed in cooperation with Polish Scout Association (ZHP) and the Warsaw Rising Museum.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BzAjnFJlRluOgxh4L5CZUw__original/img/ntk2NEVlA8yYbQ97ct3XAmfGbyg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1620355.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The preparation card can be used to cover a shot if the appropriate zone is highlighted; otherwise you must cover the shot with a card from your hand, in which case the preparation card becomes the attack.

As you gain XP from Terrain, Trap, and Creature cards, you can spend the XP to make your Heroes stronger. &#10;Accuracy is the Hero or Creatures base accuracy which you then combine with a roll of a D20 to attempt to hit.&#10;Armor is the Hero or Creatures base defense against attacks.&#10;Life is the Hero or Creatures base damage that they can take before dying.&#10;Damage is the Hero or Creatres base damage they can inflict against another.&#10; Phases of the Game:&#10;1)  Quest Deck - Turn over the appropiate amount of cards.  Fast Effects happen at this time and can change how many cards are turned over.&#10;2)  Effects - Any Effects that are turned over happen at this time.&#10;3)  Hero1 - All Heroes have one action per turn, which can be used to either Attack, Heal, Pick Up and item or attempt to Disarm a trap.  The Hero may also Hold their action for Hero2 phase.&#10;4)  Dungeon - Any surviving Creatures may perform one action at this time.&#10;5)  Hero2 - The Heroes that held their action can now act.&#10;6)  Events - Events such as traps that have not been disarmed and other Events take place at this time.&#10;7)  End of Turn - End of Turn abilities such as Regenerate and Aura's take place at this time.&#10;8)  Upgrade - XP that has been collected can now be used to upgrade your Heroes.  When a Hero is upgraded they gain full health.  Once XP has been spent on a Hero, it cannot be used again.&#10;Start the Phases over at this time.&#10; The game begins by shuffling your Quest Deck and turning over three cards.  As the game progresses and your Heroes are upgraded, you start to turn over more cards to make the Adventure more difficult.  The Breakdown is as follows:&#10;Game Begins - 3 Cards per turn&#10;After Two Hero Upgrades - 4 Cards per turn&#10;After Five Hero Upgrades - 5 Cards per turn&#10;After Eight Hero Upgrades - 6 Cards per turn&#10;After Ten Hero Upgrades - 7 Cards per turn&#10;After Twelve Hero Upgrades - 8 cards per turn&#10; Rules Questions:&#10;1)  When Attacking you take the Accuracy and add a D20 roll.

For example, Diao Chan forces an opponent paying rent to you to pay an additional 1500.

The New Ruler essentially gets to move two pawns per turn instead of one, with the Subordinate rolling his own moves but the results of the space the Subordinate's pawn landing on being resolved by the New Ruler.  &#10;             This keeps the subordinate tied to the game instead of being completely eliminated.

These companies may use all railway tracks in the Netherlands. Their only goal is to transport as many passengers as possible to their intended destinations. For these passengers the journey from Rotterdam to Amsterdam may well go via Eindhoven.&#10;&#10;Sometimes there is a sudden change of direction when the train has picked up more passengers, and a majority of those want to go to another part of the country. At other times trains may well skip stations when no passengers need to be there. And when a train does call at a station the passengers enter quickly hoping that they will arrive at their destination today. Is your train the one to be in? How many times they must change trains in order to arrive at their destination? Or will they not make it at all, because of those annoying obstructions?&#10;&#10;Introduction to the game&#10;In Koplopers en Dwarsliggers every player may construct up to three trains and each of those trains can transport up to 500 passengers. During the game you pick up passengers at stations and put their tokens at your train organizer card in the corresponding box. And then you try to transport your passengers to their destinations, after which you collect their tokens in your tray. Each turn you may spend five action points that you can use for constructing or scrapping trains, but you may also combine trains, split them up again, or reverse them. You can pick up passengers, transport them or have them change trains, and finally you can play obstruction cards or perform an emergency repair. The player who has brought the highest number of passengers to their destination wins the game.&#10;&#10;Some interesting facts&#10;&#10;        Koploper is a Dutch train type (see game box), but it also means &lsquo;front runner&rsquo;.

At once up to 5 sides - factions - can play.&#10;&#10;The plot of the game is settled in the historical reality of the 17th century, Poland's heyday, the times of the gentry, covering Europe and Asia. The designers also referred to the Polish historical and contemporary prose, like Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize winner) and Jacek Komuda.&#10;&#10;In 2009 Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier became the publisher of the game. This new publisher reprinted the basic decks designed by Wydawnictwo Imperium and added a new starter deck of Osmanowie (the Ottoman Empire - this faction was introduced by the Casus Belli expansion in boosters). Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier released their first own expansion in 2009 and further two in 2010. The line is constantly expanded with new products.&#10;&#10;Veto CCG has now seasons of the game (each season starts with releasing a set of sarter decks and contains next three expansions), which is connected with rotation of legal cards in the organized tournament system. So far Veto has had three full seasons: basic season (Veto 2ed, Charakternicy, Casus Belli, Ogniem i Mieczem), Warcho&#197;&#130;y i Pijanice (eng. &quot;Dipsos and Troublemakers&quot;, inlcuding Ogniem i Mieczem (partly), Do szabel, R&#196;&#153;baj&#197;&#130;owie, Krwi) and Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci (&quot;Spies and Dimplomats&quot;, including W niewoli, Spiskowcy, Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo).

One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master.&#10;&#10;At his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega.&#10;&#10;The Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido.&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win.&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other.&#10;&#10;The Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever cannot draw a card has lost.&#10;     The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck.&#10;     The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero.&#10;     The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future).&#10;     The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn.&#10;     The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).&#10;&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rr8OE9lwjhqf-vgzObT1dA__original/img/d7LWCnoRwYG8YLDzyB9M9Lny_Mk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic841416.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The Numberland (Zahlenland) concept has been developed continuously since the 1950&rsquo;s &ndash; notably by one of the designers,Dr. Gerhard Friedrich. The basic idea for this game is taken from the German bestseller &ldquo;Komm mit ins Zahlenland&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come with me to Numberland&rdquo;) by Friedrich de Galg&oacute;czy. The game can be used for as preparation for school and as a learning companion during the first school year. The following mathematical concepts and skills are addressed in gameplay:&#10;&#10;Cardinal number aspect (quantity aspect): Numbers are used to indicate the number or cardinality of the elements of a set (e.g. 6&#10;apples, 3 pine cones).&#10;&#10;Ordinal number aspect (order aspect): Numbers are used to indicate position in an ordered set (e.g. first, third etc.).&#10;&#10;Arithmetic aspect: Numbers indicate the result of an arithmetic operation, e.g. an addition (e.g. 5 = 3 + 2)&#10;&#10;Geometric number aspect: Numbers are used to identify geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon, triangle).&#10;&#10;Numeric image: Numbers are represented with the aid of numeral and dice images.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Numberland consists of 10 number houses, in each of which a number lives. Numberland has to be constructed correctly. But the number goblin, Jumble, is on his way from Mistake Forest to bring disorder to Numberland. Can the players stop him and build Numberland? Luckily they have the Number Fairy to help them. The players roll a die and if they roll a Numberland symbol they can construct on one of the buildings (which are completed in numerical order). If the players roll the Number Goblin their constrcutions will be mixed up and remain so until someone roll the Number Fairy, then the mix up can be corrected. Once all houses are finished we will see if Numberland is still jumbled or correct!&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KS81mkFXeYCzfSmqVdsmbA__original/img/-KItbrZI4J3oeS9_-41Ygg1lmcw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic563608.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Nerve-wracking and intense, the battle was decided by timing, strategy and good fortune. In the span of only four minutes the war in the Pacific was changed forever. The chance convergence of the Enterprise and Yorktown Strike Groups between 10:22 and 10:26 AM on June 4th led to the devastation of the Japanese flattops and sparked the infernos which would engulf the Japanese Empire.&#10;&#10;Like its predecessor, The Hell of Stalingrad, Midway drops you right into the seat of the action. You make the strategic decisions necessary to first locate the enemy fleet and then destroy it! Scramble your fighters and organize your Strike Groups for their deadly missions. Will they destroy the enemy and make it back? Your squadrons must contend not just with the enemy's anti-aircraft fire and fight vicious engagements with the enemy's CAP, but also navigate the wide and empty expanses of the ocean. Do the survivors have enough fuel for the return trip to your fleet? Or will they too be lost forever to the misfortunes of war?&#10;&#10;The Fires of Midway explores in separate scenarios the four major carrier battles of 1942: Coral Sea, Midway Island, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz. Also included is a campaign game linking them all together in which players must husband their resources not knowing which of these battles, if any, will yield the decisive result and turn the tide of war in their favor like the historical battle of Midway did.&#10;&#10;The Coral Sea can be played in as little as 1 hr and up to 2.5 hrs for the Midway Battle.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     200 playing cards&#10;     1 sheets of counters&#10;     1 large deck of 18 Carrier Cards &#10;     3 Play Mats&#10;     A 16 Page color Flight Manual (Core Rules) &#10;     A 24 Page Operations Manual (Advanced Rules)&#10;     Dice (2 different colors, D-6)&#10;     Box&#10;&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ehzrJ9j11IMXdwsiCO_yTQ__original/img/YF2R3FGiRHOCF4874YdEhTk5XC8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic675839.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The results of weapon fire are decided by casting a six-sided die and adding modifiers to account for factors such as distance. The types of weapon fire, in increasing order of deadliness, are carbines, solid shot batteries, muskets, rifles, and grape shot batteries.&#10;&#10;When enemy troops encounter each other, they cannot fire and must engage in melee. Each side rolls a six-sided die, multiplies the result by the number of units in action, and then adds modifiers to account for the quality and morale of the troops. The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or surrenders. Surrendering is the best result from the point of view of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher.&#10;&#10;Grosstaktik is appropriate for re-enacting battles from the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the War of American Independence.

The cards are available for purchase online, or at furry conventions, such as Anthrocon and Further Confusion.&#10;&#10;In Furoticon, you play as an Owner of your harem, pitting your Furres (characters) against theirs, where they will use their wit and sexual prowess to break through the opposing harems and bring their owners to orgasm. The last Owner to remain without climax is the winner!&#10;&#10;Each player in the game typically uses a 40-card deck, known as a Black Book. There is a shorter variant of the game where a 20-card deck is used, and each player starts with half Stamina Points (life).&#10;&#10;The cards are meant to be traded amongst players and collectors. Decks can be customized and improved with cards that the player owns. Cards from any of the five sets can be used interchangeably.&#10;&#10;One of the main purposes of Furoticon is to introduce players and collectors to artists that they may not have known about before. Artist credit, as well as a URL to their site, is found at the bottom of every card to encourage people to explore the artists of Furoticon.&#10;&#10;Harem members move from the Owners' Haven to the Scene, where the players can then enter Bed with their furres, and attempt to climax the other furres. Each card has a number of traits that affect gameplay, including Gender, Species, Pleasure Experience, Skills, and more. In addition to Furre cards, there are also Treats and Actions, which act as items and instant effects in the game to add a bit more depth and strategy.&#10;&#10;There are five sets so far, each with its own theme:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Vanilla: Also known as &quot;1st Vanilla&quot;, the Vanilla set was the original Furoticon set to be produced. With 179 playable cards, it provided the foundation upon which the rest of the game was built. There was no overall theme with this set, focusing instead on developing strategies and gender characteristics, as well as providing appealing artwork. 1st Vanilla boosters are no longer available on the Furoticon store, but the original Herm and Otherkin starters are still available for purchase.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Triskelion: Triskelion is Furoticon's premier BDSM set, focusing on masters and slaves, and bondage and pain play. Gameplay heavily focuses on adding &quot;pain counters&quot; to furres, which alter the Pleasure Experience (attack) values in either a positive or negative manner. Additionally, Alteration treats are prominant in this set, providing boosts to the Furres they're attached to, symbolizing bondage gear. Triskelion boosters are no longer available for purchase, but the two Starters (Male/Herm and Female/Otherkin) still are available on their website.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Second Vanilla: Second Vanilla focuses on college life, and showing the life and sexual adventures of such characters as Boy Toy and Lily Tyla. The set has no real gimmick, instead focusing on expanding the underlying foundation of the game. Second Vanilla boosters are running very low (as of December 8, 2013), and will soon be out of stock. There were no Second Vanilla starter decks.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tribes of Tanglebrook: Tribes of Tanglebrook focused on a Tribal setting, with transformation and tribal markings being the prominent theme. Each Tribe in the set has a specific gameplay focus, from Wolves and their ability to intimidate furres from entering bed, to Dragons and their slow, but extremely powerful abilities. Tribes of Tanglebrook is still available in the Furoticon store, both with Boosters and with the three Starter Decks (Otters, Wolves, and Dragons).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Third Vanilla: Strawberry:  Third Vanilla: Strawberry (Or just &quot;Strawberry&quot;) continues the college setting introduced in Second Vanilla. This set introduced Owners with special stats that alter the core rules of the game. The set did not introduce many new mechanics, instead focusing on developing the group play dynamic of the game further, and making the game easier for beginners to get into. Boosters for this set include 15 cards instead of the previous 10, and while there are no starter decks, there are two &quot;starter boxes&quot;, which come with four &quot;mini-decks&quot;, made up of 20 cards each, and designed to be used out of the box with up to 3 other players.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Di'Ahla's Awakening: Di'Ahla's Awakening is the second BDSM themed set in the Furoticon lineup. Apparently taking place before and after the events of &quot;Triskelion&quot;, It serves as an addition to the gameplay elements introduced there. Pain counters and the &quot;Masochist&quot; and &quot;Sadist&quot; abilities reign dominant in this edition just as in &quot;Triskelion&quot;. Overall simply an expansion to the overall theme and gameplay alterations made by &quot;Triskelion&quot;. There is also a BDSM Starter Set for sale which includes both of the two-player deckboxes from the &quot;Di'Ahla's Awakening&quot; edition as well as two starter decks from the &quot;Triskelion&quot; edition.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is another set planned to be released by July 2014:Fortune at Vell's End.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to XXXenophile.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Jea0alH4-z6AjsxCYD8zzA__original/img/CV-5cVTzT6sMRh1_0y3UjVtpYlk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1712834.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)&#10;&#10;A round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action &ndash; the alliance card &ndash; a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.&#10;&#10;The game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nS4LUSmkCMOqqxqIEYm0fg__original/img/D25RqXeTizk0zBK4wUmBBHO7LII=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic594433.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Timeline cards can also affect combat. There are two types of dice - green and red - and they vary in their effectiveness in scoring a hit. Green dice are used by herbivores and red by carnivores.&#10;&#10;Play consists of combats between pairs of players. During combat players take the appropriate number of combat dice, which vary according to a few simple conditions, and start rolling. The aim is to score hits against the opposing dinosaur. Jurassic Wars features an interesting game mechanism where the combat dice also serve as the number of hit points that each dinosaur can sustain in combat. After a series of rolls, one player will be left with no dice to throw and his or her dinosaur is defeated. With every combat, another dinosaur is removed from play. As the game progresses some players will lose all their dinocards and be eliminated until only one player is left standing and is the winner.&#10;&#10;The simple, probability-based game mechanism is flexible allowing for basic game parameters to be changed and also lending itself to many different variations, such as Jurassic Wars Whist, a points scoring game that involves greater skill and judgement, and Jurassic Wars Casino, a Craps-style gambling game.

IMPORTANT - If you are RIGHT handed, use your LEFT hand - and if you are LEFT handed, use your RIGHT hand for the chopping hand.&#10;TO PLAY: 1) The &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; to begin the contest. After announcing &quot;Ready&quot;, the &quot;Holder&quot; may fake, pull the brick aside, or do anything to try to fool his opponent, the &quot;Chopper&quot;, into committing himself. He must always return the brick to the &quot;Ready&quot; position to give the &quot;Chopper&quot; a chance to strike again. After each point is made the &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; before a new strike can be made. 2) The &quot;Chopper&quot; MUST KEEP HIS HAND AGAINST HIS EAR UNTIL he is READY TO CHOP. He can fake - but must always keep his hand touching the ear during the fake. Once he has started a chop, taking his hand from his ear, he must CONTINUE the chop and try to hit the brick.&#10;TO SCORE: The &quot;CHOPPER&quot; scores one point if he strikes the brick. The &quot;HOLDER&quot; scores one point if the &quot;Chopper&quot; misses the brick.&#10;After every 5 tries the players change places. The first one to score 11 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8gHFIAMmMtuSy6fzbvkgtg__original/img/VHP6QW6kYW1X0klX73hgDl5Xo3c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic566972.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

They are a small people with a population of just about 19,000 who live near the Stanley Falls not far from Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Genya were fishermen and hunters.&#10;&#10;Imbelece is only played by men as it symbolizes fertility and courtship. The Genya use the seeds of the Ngola tree (Pictantus makombo) to play the game. It seems to be related to Embeli and also to some Ethiopian mancala games such as Selus.&#10;&#10;Imbelece was first described by the British ethnograph P. Townshend in 1977. Later another description was published by the American L. Russ which was inaccurate (like so many of his accounts).&#10;&#10;There was an Imbelece tournament at the Regionale Schule, Niederzissen (Germany), on May 15, 2008, which was won by David Fischbach.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Imbelece is played on a mancala board, which consists of three rows. The outer rows have six holes. The central row has four ordinary holes and a large one in the middle, which is a store. The smaller holes are called moseka (&quot;girls&quot;). A player controls the six holes in the outer row closest to him and the holes to his right of the central row. The store is used by both players.&#10;&#10;At the beginning each girl contains three seeds called maana a moome (&quot;boys&quot;) or maana a leemba (&quot;male teenagers&quot;).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the boys of one of his holes counter-clockwise into the following girls. This is called koenda (&quot;visiting the girls&quot;). After a player has dropped the last boy into the right-most girl of his outer row, he continues sowing by visiting his girl in the central row adjacent to the store, then the girl to the right, before he switches to the opponent's outer row.&#10;&#10;If the last boy visits a girl, which contains boys, these boys including the visitor are distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;If the last boy makes a population of four boys in a girl of his opponent, this girl is &quot;closed&quot; by putting a leaf on it. The Genya call it kosongo moseka (&quot;marrying a girl&quot;) or koija moseka (&quot;killing a girl&quot;; in other words: turning a girl into a woman). For moseka, you can also say moakali (&quot;newlywed woman&quot;). Then the four boys are distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;Exception:&#10;&#10;In the first half-move no girl can be married.&#10;&#10;During sowing closed holes are skipped. If the wife was made from one of the player's girls, nothing happens. However, if she is on the opponent's side, a boy must be put into the store, before the sowing continues. This is known as ko-ongesa moakali moleli (&quot;providing food to the newlywed woman&quot; (while her husband is on a hunt)).&#10;&#10;A move or a lap may never start from a closed hole nor the store.&#10;&#10;The move ends, when the last boy falls into an empty girl or in a wife of the opponent's side (i.e. the store).&#10;&#10;The player who could move last wins.&#10;&#10;Draws and ties cannot occur.&#10;&#10;Strategy&#10;&#10;The girls in the lower right and upper left corners are known as ipaoko (&quot;respectable girls&quot;). A boy who marries such a girl in real life, will enhance his social prestige, a player who marries her in the game will have a big advantage.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, '', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Thus, the victorious player-king is the one most reknown for his wealth, combat prowess, and political/military power.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 7, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1oSWIa5N9JLH22S1ss3FYg__original/img/oA_eQLqKszv5KAJVCSWZ3LAqULw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic631918.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

After months of constant retreats and loss, the Don River offered a respite. Even though the river was partially frozen, crossing proved difficult for either side except at one of the four bridges which span it. Weather and time also proved to be a friend of Denikin one last time, as both sides had to fight freezing temperatures and slowed the rapid advance of the Red Army chasing them into Rostov, a small city at the time. Much of the Red forces that reached the city were to too small and the main body of the army was still several days away.&#10;&#10;Denikin pulled his forces back to Bataisk and dug in and by the time the Red lead elements arrived, the Reds found themselves in a much weaker position because Denikin had gathered his units. Denikin planned for a quick offensive, one to retake Rostov and hopefully beyond to buy additional time before the inevitable. Retaking Rostov would also be a desperately needed morale boost. Thus, he gathered his last available Mk V tanks, aircraft, and reinforced his elite Volunteer Army. He suddenly struck, completely taking the Red units by surprise, routing many. Within a day or so, he entered Rostov, and pushed onto the suburbs along the fringe. The reversal was complete. Stunning. Morale rose. But, like the Germans and the Ardennes in 1944, the weight of the Red army was felt once it arrived.

To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.&#10;&#10;The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.&#10;&#10;So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.&#10;&#10;These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar.

Well Here Is Your Chance!&#10;&#10;The game consists of two parts. The Fraze card which details a type of sentence category along the lines of tongue twisters, compliments, insults, confessions, secrets, gibberish etc and a second deck of cards called Exploits. Exploits are ways in which the sentence should be read, or act as a distraction while trying to read the phrase. Exploit categories for example might be miming a death scene, talking in your best German accent, or reading the sentence really fast.&#10;&#10;During any particular players' turn there are two people in an interaction. The Scribe and the Reciter; the Scribe has the challenge of choosing from a limited number of fraze and exploits that he believes the Reciter will find difficult to say in front of a group. He must consider several things, his personal knowledge of the Reciter, such as personal hang ups about saying something silly in front of a group, whether his spirit could say take the brunt awkwardness of confessing to something he didn't do, while perhaps talking like a munchkin.&#10;&#10;The Reciter will have his/her social inhibitions challenged in simply performing in front of a group, pronouncing a made up word, or punching out a tongue twister. Since the Reciter has a very limited time to process what he/she is about to say it also provides a psycological component as it can sometimes be difficult to psyche oneself up under limited time constraints.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded according to a simple scale, whether the Reciter was able to read the sentence out loud under duress without stopping, laughing, stammering etc, within five seconds, and whether he was able to perform the exploit to a satisfactory level.&#10;&#10;There is a simple system where disagreements regarding the performance was acceptable or not, or whether the attempt was successful.&#10;&#10;Buy a copy of Frazed Today!&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;* fraze Deck (75 cards)&#10;    * exploit Deck (71 cards)&#10;    * Frazed Rules Deck (12 cards)&#10;    * frazed rules Document&#10;&#10;$$, 4, 8, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZPFNhklfS5ldsW9rscRl2A__original/img/Y7iT60jIXDPQxL9-oc27JkULa-w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic570215.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Taking control of those industries will finance your efforts. Along the way you'll pick up equipment and hire additional MERCs. You'll need to train guards to fortify and hold territory after you've taken it.&#10;&#10;There are 50 unique MERCs for you to hire, each with their own personalities, special abilities, skills, and weaknesses. The right combination of MERCs will lead you to victory, but you'll have to compete to hire them against the other players who are also drawing from the same talent pool.&#10;&#10;MERCs would be nothing without their equipment. The game offers more than 40 different types of equipment. There are various types of weapons; everything from a simple 9mm handgun, all the way up to a shoulder mounted assault weapon (SMAW). There are various types of armor and accessories. And you can even get vehicles like tanks and helicopters to assist in your conquest.&#10;&#10;Every game of MERC is unique, because the map deck allows you to reconfigure the island of Tenagra so many ways. Plus, some times the best MERCs are killed in the first couple days on the island, so you have to fight your way to victory with their lesser counterparts.

The player to his left then rolls the 6-sided die. The caller then consults his card and reads out the corresponding clue as the player rolled.

Each marker has a number ranging from zero to five which represents the number of nobles that the player is placing in that area.  Most actions in the game require a player to remove a noble cube from an area in order to perform an action in that area.  Players also have income-generating estates in the different areas of Poland, and these holdings may determine which areas a player is most eager to defend.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players may raise private armies and use them to strike at the five nations that threaten the different areas of Poland.  If a player is successful enough at attacking an enemy nation, then that nation may not have the resources to attack Poland that turn.  Later, a roll of four die will determine which enemy nations receive reinforcements, and then enemy nations will take their turn attacking Poland.  A successful enemy invasion of Polish territory may result in players losing one or more estates in that region.&#10;&#10;&#10;Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko - Dzieje Rzeczpospolitej Szlacheckiej.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nierz&#196;&#133;dem Polska stoi&quot; -  nie&#197;&#186;le kto&#197;&#155; powiedzia&#197;&#130;;&#10;Lecz drugi odpowiedzia&#197;&#130;, &#197;&#188;e nierz&#196;&#133;dem zginie.&#10;Pan B&oacute;g nas ma jak b&#197;&#130;azn&oacute;w.

Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.&#10;&#10;Link to Trailer http://www.queen-games.de/index.php?id=2537----2&#10;&#10;Play Differences from Alhambra&#10;Alhambra advanced. Play is the same: buy a building tile, take money or remodel. If you buy a tile for the exact amount, you can take another action, same as in Alhambra. The differences: new building types, building values are dynamic, two-sided tiles, and moats instead of walls.&#10;&#10;There are 9 building types in Granada. Unlike Alhambra, the buildings do not have a set value. Instead, building value is determined by the count of that type of building in all players' cities times a multiplier. As in Alhambra, there are 3 scoring rounds during which each building type is examined and points awarded for the player with the majority of that type of building. In the first scoring round, A, only the player with the most tiles of a particular building type scores for that building type (1 times the total count). In the second scoring round, B, the top 2 players score (2 times the total count and 1 times the total count respectively), and in the final round, the top 3 score (3x, 2x, and 1x the total count of that building type). Scoring for a &quot;Beginners Game&quot; is a little different.&#10;&#10;There are no ties in Granada: points are never divided like in Alhambra. In the case of two players having the same number of tiles of a particular type in their cities, the player with the highest valued tile of that type wins, and the other player takes next place. So, in Granada, it pays to buy the more expensive buildings.&#10;&#10;For example: When the A round-scoring card is turned up, Cindy has 2 Schools, Diana has 2, Tim has 1, Tina and Bailey each have 0, for a total of 5 Schools currently in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Diana's is a 7. So, in round A, Cindy would score 1 x 5 = 5 points.&#10;&#10;When the B round-scoring card is turned up, the count for Schools is: Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina and Bailey 0 each for a total of 6 Schools. So, Diana scores 2 x 6 = 12 points and Cindy scores 1 x 6 = 6 points.&#10;&#10;In the final round, the School count is Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina 2, Bailey 0 for a total of 8 Schools in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Tina's is a 4. So, Diana scores 3 x 8 = 24 points, Cindy score 2 x 8 = 16 points and Tina score 1 x 8 = 8 points.&#10;&#10;Another difference in Granada is that the tiles are two-sided: on one side an even-numbered building of some type, on the other a different, odd-numbered building valued exactly one higher. The configuration of the buildings on both sides is identical in terms of moat placement or lack thereof on each side. When purchasing a building, a player can immediately place the building, as is, into her city or may flip it to the other side and place it in her supply for later placement during a remodel action.&#10;&#10;The Building Market is initially filled with tiles even-side up. The next time the market is filled, the odd side will be placed up, then even, then odd, etc. A handy toggle feature is provided on the board near the Building Market to facilitate this.&#10;&#10;The last difference between Alhambra and Granada, moats instead of walls, is really just a difference in artwork. As in Alhambra, during each scoring round, each player scores points for her longest continuous moat, instead of wall, surrounding her city. The rules are the same regarding tile placement: must be able to trace an unbroken path back to the city's center, moat can touch moat, etc. In games I've played, players have often commented that it seems to be harder to build with the moat tiles of Granada than with the wall tiles of Alhambra. Just one more way to make Granada an advanced version of Alhambra?&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/33j0tzB4UzqcA6ghuJQuYw__original/img/mPteBqaEAoQyGekD9lIH9aPaE64=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic575043.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The board has numbered spaces for 10 noun cards, a space for the adjective card, and a scoring track. The noun cards are drawn and placed face-up, one in each of the numbered spaces on the board. An adjective card is turned over. Players select the one noun they think most closely fits the adjective, place their vote face down on the table, and then take turns revealing their selection. The answer receiving the greatest number of votes is deemed the winning answer and the players who chose the winning answer move ahead one space. In a case where there is no clear majority, no one scores. Hence the name, Consensus.&#10;&#10;The key to the difference between the Junior Edition and the other editions of Consensus is the content of the noun and adjective cards.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race&rsquo;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.&#10;&#10;Each Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;But the war doesn&rsquo;t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EWi-utp09EIJnwia_o_Taw__original/img/qF_KgqLXIoXy41sGezN3ie34_Io=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5152378.png', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&#10;&#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards.

The game takes place in a fantasy world of insects that is secretly ruled by the evil Tyrant and his sidekick Niljake (Slimy). In the beginning, the insect realms have different amounts of resources; some are poor while some have plenty. The poorest player, being the most desperate and thus also bravest, starts. The game is a mix of co-operative and individual play, as typically the players can only advance on the board by sharing their income. Likewise, the draconian measures of the Tyrant usually affect all the players and not just the intended victim. The idea is to expose the Tyrant and fill everyone's resources, and the winner is the player who accomplishes the second goal after the first one has already been accomplished.&#10;&#10;The three types of resource are: Food &amp; Water, Money &amp; Wealth, Education &amp; Rights.&#10;&#10;The insect realms are:&#10;&#10;1.

You start as the ruler of a single kingdom, but over the course of the game kingdoms can change hands, and you may find yourself wearing several crowns - or no crown at all. Your ultimate goal is to gain Glory by enriching the kingdoms you have had the opportunity to rule; when you develop a kingdom&rsquo;s institutions or increase the size of its domain by conquering new lands, you gain Glory. Accumulate enough Glory and you get to claim an Achievement, which grants all your kingdoms a special bonus or capability. When all Achievements have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most Glory wins.&#10;&#10;Blood of Kings is a unique blend of warfare, civilization building, and political maneuvering. Each turn you choose the course of action for each of your kingdoms. Will you attempt to expand militarily, or focus on developing institutions to make your kingdoms stronger, more productive, and more culturally advanced? At some point you will have to divert attention and resources away from these projects to root out enemies at court, for your rule is never truly secure - other players are your constant rivals, quietly positioning themselves to claim rights to your throne or thrust your kingdoms into violent rebellion. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, you can find your crown stripped away and given to another, forcing you into exile to brood and plot your eventual return to power.&#10;&#10;Blood of Kings is card-driven, but not in the traditional manner. Each kingdom has its own hand of Kingdom cards, each of which denotes a type of action (development, raising troops, taxation, etc.), and each turn its ruler chooses one card to play from those still in hand. It is through these actions that players gain Glory and win the game. However, each player also has a hand of Dynasty cards, which he can use each turn to hinder other kingdoms, improve his political hold on his own kingdoms, or prepare to take political control of rival kingdoms. Therefore, each player must work not only to expand and improve his kingdoms, but to defend his kingdoms against political rivals while positioning himself to take over as many kingdoms as possible.&#10;&#10;The game is of the free D.I.Y. variety - you will have to print your own components. Playing time is scalable. Since the game ends when all available Achievements have been claimed, you can set up a short game by using only a few Achievements, or create a truly epic game by making all of the Achievements available.&#10;&#10;$$, 3, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bnPXNPS9PASyvHU1XiS9oA__original/img/HtHC7-ZO2D92OplT78eWl-78wYM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic936714.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power.

The throw for the serve decides whether it is an ace, a fault, or in play resulting in either a groundstroke rally or the server at the net. Subsequent shots in the rally can be winners or faults, change the positions of the players (at the net or baseline) or keep them as is. There are slightly differing shot results for each die roll, depending on the positioning of the players, and what sort of shot is played (passing shot or lob when the opponent is at the net, smash or volley when you are at the net).&#10;&#10;The 'advanced' game follows the same format as the dice game, but allows players to have cards that can be used instead of a throw of the dice. The number of these cards is limited, so there is some player judgement as to when best to play them, or roll the die. 3 Cards are given when serving (presumably so the server usually has more cards than the receiver, and thus an advantage) and 1 card for the winner of each game. The cards either are the equivalent of throwing a &quot;6&quot; (e.g. Service ace, passing shot winner, or the &quot;hit glorious and impossible winning shot&quot; (which can be beaten by another one!) ) or introduce another event such as a let or foot fault on the opponent's serve.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;2 D6&#10;2 die shakers&#10;pack of 52 cards &#10;drawstring bag&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nupKpHTCFlAsqMjPCZJcjw__original/img/pvmluP2rljUOrr7vruN197McFNo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic583629.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

It is basically a 100-games-in-1 cardgame system. &#10; The Rainbow Deck (RD) 4.0 is a cardgame system that has a total of 162 cards. There are 12 suits with each suit having 13 ranks, and total 6 Joker cards. The suits are represented by colour and digit. The ranks are from 0 to 9, J to K. The cards are also numbered at one corner from 0 to 119, and another corner having alphabet letters. At the center of the card, there is a picture and word for playing picture or word related games. Surrounding the picture are 4 triangles for playing path-laying games.&#10;&#10;The RD can be adapted to play a variety of modern designer games, like what a deck of playing cards does for traditional cardgames. The difference is that the RD has 8 more suits, numbers from 0 to 119 as well as alphabet letters, thus it is most suitable for playing abstract games that require numbers, colours or letters. It can also be used by game designers as components in their own prototype games. Players can also combine the RD with other boardgames with components having colours, numbers or letters to form new games!&#10;&#10;The RD can be complemented by 6 colours x 27 chips, 6 coloured dice and 6 coloured pawns/meeples. This allows playing of cardgames that require chips, dice or pawns. The chips can be marked using permanent markers with the corresponding values on one side. Also, the cardbacks have a 2x2 checkerboard pattern and they can be used to form boards which, together with the chips and pawns, can be used to play a variety of abstract games.&#10;&#10;Decks that the RD can be mapped into&#10;&#10;     Sequence of numbers of 0 to 119&#10;     Letters with values similar to Letter Head&#10;     12 suits (colour/number) x 1-13 values&#10;     6 suits (icon) x 1-23 values (2x10+3)&#10;     6 suits (icon) x 2 copies of 1-13 values&#10;     12 suits (colour/number) x 2 copies of 1-6 dice values&#10;     6 suits (icon) x 4 copies of 1-6 dice values &#10;     6 suits (icon) x 26 letter cards&#10;     n * 26 letter cards + rare letter cards&#10;     1 copy x value 1,..., 12 copies x value 12(Q), 13 copies x value 13(K+joker)&#10;     Double-Nine domino set x 2 copies&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Rainbow Deck - A Deck for Infinite Games!&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Interesting idea.

The priests of Ra seek to extend their power and fame. They do this by directing farmers, warriors, merchants, and scribes. They cause others to build granaries, fortresses, markets, and libraries. And they erect a gigantic pyramid for the glory of the Sun God Ra!&#10;&#10;This game is a rework of Ra, with most of the same rules but completely different scoring tiles that come up for auction, some of which are two-sided, requiring players to choose which side they will make available for themselves... and for their opponents.&#10;&#10;Board &amp; Pieces: The Board has 2 tracks, effectively time and auction.  Also there is a space between the two track for a spare bidding tile.  In a bag are all the Collectible tiles, some double sided, consisting of Sun of Ra, Priests, Plagues, People, Buildings &amp; Pyramids.  Bidding Tiles, used to win auctions.  Auction Token, used to show active player to maintain play order.&#10;&#10;Play: The game is played over 3 epochs (rounds).  Each round ends when the Sun of Ra (time) track is filled.  &#10;Any non Sun tile is placed on the Auction track, in the case of double sided tiles the active player decides which side to use.  Auctions can either be called by a player (instead of drawing a tile), or automatic when the auction track is filled.  Each player may make one open bid, or pass.  The winner takes the tiles in the auction track and swaps his bidding tile with the one in the middle.  If all players pass (for example to avoid Plague tiles) then these tiles are taken out of play.&#10;&#10;Scoring: At the each epoch VPs, or Ankhs, are awarded for most of a type or a variety of People &amp; Buildings.  Penalties are awarded for Plagues (which can be offset by a number of Priests).  People and Priest tiles are then taken out of play, Buildings, Pyramids &amp; Plagues are carried over into the next epoch, so can be scored again.  At the end of the 3rd epoch, Pyramids are also scored by construction height and tiles used.  Ankh collections are now converted to points.  Finally a bonus &amp; penalty is also awarded depending on a players bidding tiles.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 5, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8gpQSjmY0XCj4-NTsSvkNw__original/img/j0dNmwzQtEhLXewW9FH3cZmUYzQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3711759.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Limited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.&#10;&#10;The War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one&rsquo;s resources. The additional armies and characters of this version also enrich the theme and make it more true to the entire Tolkien saga of the Ring War.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ABidZ-5QoNx_-LD1rRzdIQ__original/img/I3OS6FUtx3sVfj_ft8mVteOTFgk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic592209.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

It is a simple roll and move game played with two dice, with spaces that cause you to move back, lose a turn, etc. If one reads the rules which are printed on the game board, there is also an element of gambling as well as elements of an early party or drinking game.&#10;&#10;The game starts by the players agreeing on &quot;what to play for,&quot; &quot;which is to be lay'd down and then you must throw who shall play first.&quot; Some spaces require the player to put up an additional wager: &quot;He that throws upon 38 must feast with Cupid paying his share, that is, as much as he stak'd down first, and must remain there till his Companions have play'd once about.&quot; If you land on space 30 you have to wash yourself in the fountain &quot;until dispac'd by some other.&quot; If you land on 59, the bottle space, the player is &quot;to drink a Glass and pay a stake till his turn comes to throw again.&quot;&#10;&#10;The earliest known version was published in Antwerp, ca. 1620, by Pieter de Jode as &quot;El Juego Real de Cupido&quot;.  A copy of this version, published for the Spanish market, can be seen in the British Library (ref: Maps * 999(1) See also: https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-of-cupid-a-17th-century-board-game). A French translation was published in Paris, ca. 1640, by the widow of Charles Petit as &quot;Jeu Royal de Cupidon&quot; (private collection http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240 ) and a version was published in Amsterdam, ca. 1625&ndash;1640, by Claes Jansz. Visscher. This version, &quot;Het Nieuw slange Spel anders Genaemt Koninclycke Tytkorting van Cupido&quot; (&quot;The New Snake Game, otherwise known as the Royal Pastime of Cupid&quot;), introduced the peasant dance as the central motif, which was reproduced in some later English editions. A copy can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369).&#10;&#10;The earliest known British edition was published ca. 1690&ndash;1700 by John Garrett at his shop &quot;next the stayres of the Royal Exchange in Cornhill&quot;, London, with the peasant dance motif. A copy of the Garrett edition is included in the George Clarke print collection, Worcester College, Oxford (http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html).&#10;&#10;William Dicey published an edition ca. 1736&ndash;40 from his press in Bow Churchyard, London, using the same design. An example of the Dicey edition can be found in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library [where it is incorrectly dated &quot;1794&quot;]: (http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-4276-a090-cc2b2851ffba).&#10;&#10;A different design was employed in the edition published by Laurie &amp; Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, London, in 1794. The central motif shows cupid sharpening his arrow. A copy of the Laurie &amp; Whittle edition is included in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library (http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0a-9055-f3418ff9dd94). This edition was published in a later state by R. H. Laurie (Laurie's son) ca. 1850. An example can be found in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;A E.1747-1754 http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-of-cupid-board-game-r-h-laurie/). James Lumsden &amp; Son of Glasgow also used this design in an edition published ca. 1810&ndash;1830. A copy of the Lumsden edition is also included in the John Johnson ephemera collection (http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a0-93e4-631277631bef).&#10;&#10;A third design was used by the Bowles family. The first Bowles edition was published by Carington Bowles, St Paul's Churchyard, London. The game is included in Carington Bowles's &quot;New &amp; Enlarged Catalogue&quot; published in 1784, so we can estimate a similar publication date for the game (it is not included in the earlier Bowles catalogue, published by John Bowles &amp; Son, in 1753). A later state of this edition was issued Carington Bowles's son, Henry Carington Bowles, who traded from the St Paul's Churchyard address as Bowles &amp; Carver between 1793 and 1830.&#10;&#10;While the coiled serpent design is reminiscent of the ancient Egytptian game  Mehen, there is no evidence of any relation between the two other than the spiral track.  The same can be said of the relation between this game, as well as of Mehen and the Game of Goose being related to the Phaistos Disk, which dates to about 1600 BCE and which some have theorized may be an ancient board game. We are sure, however, that &quot;The Royal Pastime of Cupid, or Entertaining Game of the Snake&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;The Game of the Goose&quot;.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 10, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3bURpY7iKcM9dfMiiKyZw__original/img/NiI19c5cyi3k0vVK5vec31ia9DQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic591098.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles.

This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).&#10;&#10;The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qWX7s3RxorF26Ry9sIt8vA__original/img/-gkqPhuWEH07RYfsE5J6UDWkOfc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic956363.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

A strong relation means an alliance, and alliances are crucial as voters first choose which alliance that suits them best, and then which party within that alliance. A lonely extreme party has a small chance of presenting a complete and appealing policy package, while a large and stable alliance will harvest many voters. On the other hand, sacrificing your party identity to suit your allies might also mean losing your core voters to the more radical parties.&#10;&#10;The game is thus cooperative/competitive; take one for the team, but make sure you're not doing all the work in keeping together - don't forget to grab a bunch of voters for yourself!&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 10, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gN978c9pa1iovQC8plecBw__original/img/C9cp6XD1Nr8YkLVtqTWxR4AXsLw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic828913.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.&quot;&#10;&#10;Though the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled.

The idea was to create a set of skirmish rules that were quick to play, fun, colourful and different to other rule sets. We wanted to play games featuring mythical warriors such as Robin Hood, Achilles and King Arthur, and historical legends like Alexander of Macedon, Frederick Barbarossa and William the Conqueror.&#10;&#10;The focus of development was therefore to create rules that favoured the heroes and legends of past centuries at the expense of the common soldier. Death or Glory (DoG) does this, and makes such heroes and legends quite literally deadly on the tabletop. BUT, and this is a big but, they are not unbeatable. If you charge King Arthur into a unit of enemy warriors on his own, with no support or strategy and it&rsquo;s going to hurt - or could even be fatal! But use him as he should be, a legendary fighter, and he will carve his away around a battlefield - just as he does in the movies.&#10;&#10;The idea is to use DoG to re-enact scenes from a movie, book or graphic novel, or make up your own encounters using lots of models. Whether you have Leonidas cutting a path through Persian Immortals to save an injured companion, or Jason trying to fight his way through skeletons to the safety of his ship, DoG is perfect for recreating such encounters.&#10;&#10;This rulebook loosely covers the Dark Ages, as the statistic cards that are provided are for fairly generic European warriors with chain armour and large shields. There are also two specific lists with statistic cards for Norse and Saxon warriors. Additional supplements and/or downloads will be made available from the Downloads section of this web site.&#10;&#10;The DoG rules have now been fully playtested and are being designed, ready for printing. We anticipate that shops will have stock of the rule book in late 2009.

Be careful though, because every player is approached by different manufacturers and will do everything to get control over the intermediate product, which appears on the board.&#10;&#10;Explanation&#10;&#10;Conceptualize This! is a card game in which every player gets a unique target. During the game you try to collect cards which &quot;connect&quot; to each other in a dominos like way. The set of cards you collect results in a concept of the intermediate product, build up out of different components that need each other to function. The board supports the concept of tile (card) placement in such a way that the connections between the cards are made visible. The game is won by the player who completes his / her concept of the intermediate product on the board.&#10;&#10;Background&#10;&#10;The development on this board game started as an element of a Bachelor thesis. For the research in this thesis the board game was meant to educate people on how to model UML activity diagrams (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of actions are modelled) in a fast and easy way. During the creation of the board game the accent moved to a system diagram (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of components are modelled) which gave more freedom in the creation of cards. Because the concepts used in both modelling languages are the same, people should still be able to create an activity diagram after playing the game.&#10;&#10;At first the game seemed to have a very high luck rate, but closer to completion the game turned out to be tactical as well. Due to this development a few extra rules were included which made the game even more tactical and increased the replay value.&#10;&#10;The research on the Bachelor thesis for which this board game is created is still in progress. The board game itself however is completed and only needs to be stylised. If a publisher can be found the game will be published in the future. Currently both Dutch and English versions can be previewed by publishers.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3S3ox8dns2WWpAlf4YuSsQ__original/img/H1iLvyJqpzcVfmG0p-ZLQhd3Ia0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic732502.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;).

Urban Sprawl abstractly models the growth of a town into a teeming metropolis.&#10;&#10;Players assume the roles of entrepreneur, tycoon, and politician&mdash;each helping in the development of a hypothetical &quot;Anywhere, USA.&quot; Wealth and Prestige will be earned and spent throughout the game. Buildings will rise only to later be demolished for better and larger fare.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game players will gather valuable Permits. These will result in either a wealthy Investment or the foundation of a new building Contract. Players will strive to become dominant in one or more building Zones in order to acquire beneficial political offices.&#10;&#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;a vibrant metropolis that is revered around the world&mdash;when the player with the most Prestige will be crowned the winner.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;The grid of streets on the board provides the framework for building the small town. The buildings will be placed within the grid and identified with control markers (wooden cubes) to show each player's contribution to the growing urban area. Each building's value is determined by the cumulative Wealth and Prestige values of the block in which is it constructed.&#10;&#10;At the start of a player's turn he may discard one or more Building Permit cards from hand as &quot;Investments,&quot; gaining Wealth in doing so. Next that player gets 6 &quot;Action Points&quot; (APs) with which to spend on any of the the following activities:&#10;&#10;&bull; Acquiring new Building Permit cards from those available to choose;&#10;&bull; Constructing new buildings from those currently available;&#10;&bull; Acquiring a &quot;Favor&quot;&mdash;a Building Contract that only that player can build.&#10;&#10;Each activity carries with it a variable cost in APs, depending on where the chosen card lies on the board.&#10;&#10;Once a player has spent his APs it's time for a quick reset phase in readiness for the next player's turn. It is during this phase that events can occur, elections can be held for the various political offices, and players receive payouts in Wealth and Prestige. Wealth payouts provide funding for new buildings while Prestige payouts provide victory points.&#10;&#10;Generally, players will be trying to build in areas that provide better payouts. Players are also looking to construct more buildings of a particular &quot;zone&quot;&mdash;Government, Residential, Industrial, or Commercial&mdash;in order to help them win an election, as the politicians each confer a special ability to the player holding the office. Many of the buildings also provide a one-time bonus as they are built, and players can benefit from construction in the right neighborhoods.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the values of the buildings will generally increase as the town grows into a city and then a large metropolis. Neighborhoods that were once valuable can become run down and new city centers spring up as the urban areas sprawl out across the grid.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each Prestige row, earn points based on accumulated Wealth, and score bonus points for political offices held&mdash;after which the player with the highest Prestige total wins the game.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K1Q9nY-BKLZb15ijxFkk_g__original/img/lfUB3hBk_cic7xUYmZxAhd7BGFg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1114652.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

One of the first major Crusader defeats.&#10;     Montgisard (1177): Saladin attempts to destroy a small army from the Kingdom of Jerusalem with an army more than five times its size.

As a tactical representation of naval warfare, each of the ships is accurately modeled for offensive capability including gunnery, ramming and spar torpedoes; for defensive capability including damage and five distinct armored or wooden hit locations; and for maneuverability, crew size and draft.&#10;&#10;You command 70 famous ships of the era, including the Union: Onondaga, Tecumseh, Winnebago, Monitor, Osage, Minnesota, Brooklyn, Hartford, Essex, Carondolet, Kearsarge, Ossipee, Queen of the West, Iroquois, Spuyten Duyvil; and the Confederate: Tennessee, Virginia, Atlanta, Palmetto State, Arkansas, Albemarle, Alabama, Florida, General Beauregard, Sumter; and many more.&#10;&#10;Many of the 14 scenarios, in this easy-to-learn game, are playable in an hour or less. Included are 13 historical and 1 hypothetical engagements featuring Hampton Roads, Mobile Bay, Trent&rsquo;s Reach, Wassaw Sound, the duel between Alabama and the Kearsarge, and the saga of the Arkansas, which may be played as three individual scenarios or as a linked mini-campaign.&#10;&#10;In addition, forts bristling with guns make their appearance to challenge the will of the ship captains. If that was not enough to heat things up, scenario based optional rules add a few interesting &lsquo;what if&rsquo; situations to expand on play.&#10;&#10;If you are interested in commanding your own fleet, Iron and Oak includes a standalone campaign module where player selected forces fight it out in the many rivers, bays, inlets and costal areas. The campaign game recreates the brown water actions, typical of the period, in a series of randomly generated battles. As play progresses, the players do not know the exact length of the campaign or the specific mix of the battles. Players must not only manage the unfolding battles, but must also strategically allocate resources and repair and refits their ships. The 16 card Navy Yard deck is used to plot a course through and influence the challenges of the campaigns.&#10;&#10;Two or more players battle it out on an 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map that features an area movement grid. This simple approach controls ship movement as well as all combat action. Gone are the long periods of inaction, typical of ACW tactical naval games, as these early steam-era ships struggled to maneuver into battle.&#10;&#10;This innovative game system places the emphasis on quick action and tactical decision making. The 50 Action Cards are used to assist and enhance play, not drive it. Each time you battle it out, whether in a scenario or campaign game, the action unfolds in a very different manner. Do you wish to employ hot shot or incendiary shells? Is now the best time to rapid fire or is it wise to maneuver and ram? Should you allocate part of the crew as a repair party? Is that enemy ship going to maneuver into your torpedo (mine) field? These and many other possibilities exist through the play of the action cards. Or, you may decide to not play any action cards at all and just maneuver and shoot. You control how and when the action will unfold.&#10;&#10;At its core Iron and Oak is a naval simulation. It accurately models the close-range slugging matches typical of the period. You have the opportunity to play out the various battles to their conclusion. Will history repeat itself, or will a new account be written? Will the Monitor&rsquo;s 11&rdquo; Dahlgren smoothbores blast through Virginia&rsquo;s armor plating or will their battle again end in a stalemate? Will the powerful Tennessee win out against Admiral David Farragut&rsquo;s Union fleet or again fall to his superior numbers? Will the Atlanta defeat the two Union monitors in kind or again slip aground and strike her colors. This time, you get to determine the outcome. You are not bound by history&rsquo;s stories.&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KIWvFMnGp63foMwPfwqlCQ__original/img/YEFtGjDT-nR6LZU9lKkZCOVSTB4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1651133.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions&rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West.

That game covered the early part of the War in Europe, from 1939 to early 1942. It was followed a few years later by the Eighth Air Force expansion module, which added aircraft and campaigns for the latter part of the war.&#10;&#10;Since then there have been two more games (Corsairs and Hellcats, Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942), two packs of additional aircraft (Down in Flames Squadron Pack 1: Fighters, Down in Flames Squadron Pack 2: Bombers), and a large number of C3i modules for the series. However, the original two games have been long out of print. GMT has considered a number of options to address that, from straight reprints to a base game/campaign module arrangement. Finally, though, the company has decided to P500 an entire new game covering the war in the ETO (European Theatre of Operations) from 1940-1944.&#10;&#10;Wild Blue Yonder is a true deluxe Down in Flames product. It contains a dozen full campaigns, over 200 aircraft cards, plus all of the necessary targets, resource sheets, and play aids needed for play. All of this is packaged in a large box similar to the ones for the Combat Commander games.&#10;&#10;Many of the campaigns are on the same subjects as those in Rise of the Luftwaffe, 8th Air Force and various C3i modules. However, they are not simple reprints of those campaigns. Wild Blue Yonder contains three different types of campaigns: Land Campaigns, Progressive Campaigns, and Operations (The Schweinfurt Raids, for example). The first type is the familiar &ldquo;standard&rdquo; DiF campaign to which players of the system are accustomed. Progressive Campaigns give both players a fixed &ldquo;order of battle&rdquo; along with reinforcements and replacements they will have to use throughout the campaign. This reflects the more attritional nature of these air campaigns.

So if he intends to win the battle, he will have to do it almost blind.&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;A rectangular 4x5 game board (20 grey spaces).&#10;Six red pieces (monsters) for one necromancer and six black ones for the other. Each set will include one black knight, two zombies and three skeletons. The following symbols will be inscribed on one side of the pieces: a helm for black knights, a zombie&rsquo;s face for zombies and a skull for skeletons.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;At the beginning, the board is empty. Each player (necromancer) chooses one colour and takes the corresponding six pieces (1 black knight, 2 zombies and 3 skeletons). Those pieces will be set face down (symbols hidden). Therefore, the players will not know the identities of the members of their army (until they are required to be displayed).&#10;The board will be oriented so that there is a distance of five spaces between the players.&#10;&#10;MONSTERS AND TEAMS&#10;&#10;Any evil lord knows black knights are more skilled warriors than zombies, and zombies fight better than skeletons. So, when attacking, a black knight will defeat any other opponent; a zombie will beat a skeleton or another zombie but will be beaten by a black knight, and a skeleton will only defeat another skeleton. When attacked, a black knight will only be overcome by another black knight; a zombie will be beaten by a black knight or another zombie and a skeleton will always lose the fight.&#10;A player can decide to take the risk and join forces by forming groups (teams) of two (2-teams) or three (3-teams) pieces (putting one on another). In that case, the cave&rsquo;s magic determines that 2-teams always fight like a zombie and 3-teams always battle like a black knight, whichever the identities of their monsters may be.&#10;&#10;MOVES&#10;&#10;Every piece or team behaves the same way:&#10;-Move: orthogonal to an adjacent (and empty) space.&#10;-Attack: diagonal to an adjacent space occupied by a foe. Defeated pieces are immediately removed from the board and successful attackers take their position.&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;&#10;A player wins when he gets rid of all his opponent&rsquo;s pieces, keeping at least one of his pieces on the board.

Like its predecessor, Fatal Alliances is all encompassing and represents every theater and aspect of the First World War. Fatal Alliances expands upon the military system of World in Flames to highlight the diplomatic and civilian fronts.&#10;&#10;When we think of the First World War, we often think of miles of static trenches stretching along the Western Front. Indeed trench warfare was a huge component of the war, but many theaters in the Middle East, Russia, the Balkans, and even Africa were very dynamic &ndash; as even the Western Front was at times. Moreover, Fatal Alliances focuses on the major technological changes the war brought on, on land, at sea, and in the air. In order to prevail on the battlefield, you must coordinate artillery, elite ace-led air forces, gas units, shock troops, engineering units, infantry, cavalry, and early tanks.&#10;&#10;The First World War was truly global, and in Fatal Alliances, the Eastern Front, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Africa, and even Asia and the Americas play a major role. German forces are loose in Africa, and South Africa's loyalty is uncertain. Italy will go to the highest bidder. The Ottomans face Russians in the Caucasus and British Forces along the Suez Canal. China is in turmoil, and could potentially join either side. Japan is nominally an Ally, but Japanese expansionism is already at odds with the interests of other Allied powers. Russia is primed for revolution, with Bolsheviks facing Tsarist forces in a battle for control of the largest swath of land in Eurasia.&#10;&#10;To guide your nation to victory, you must navigate the world of international politics, swaying both minor and major powers to your side. Can you survive civil unrest or military revolution at home, while instigating it abroad? Can you prevent your troops from refusing to fight, and maintain control of your far-flung colonies? Strategic warfare on the seas and in the air must form a vital part of your strategy, preserving your nation&rsquo;s own will to fight while degrading the enemy&rsquo;s. Whatever your strategy, Fatal Alliances: The Great War is a truly dynamic and all-encompassing simulation of every theater of the First World War.&#10;&#10;1680 counters represent the armies, navies, and air forces, which fought in the Great War. Two to five players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when, and how? No two games of Fatal Alliances play the same, no strategy is foolproof, and any decision may have unforeseen consequences.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pYrAMItecIMYkipztEAvWw__original/img/wfj6ureQ9iO0WwEKGEz_3WioCDw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2673386.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

You start with just 1.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence:&#10;1) Each player throws the chancebowl and gets raw materials (Wood, rock, animal, grain, lavender)(wooden pieces). &#10;2)The raw material has to be processed in a workshop in order to become a useful product (product cards). Because the other players have the other workshops you'll have to negotiate with them to get you material processed. This makes players dependent of each other. With the product card a player can build a workshop, farm, castle, big castle or a witchery.&#10;3)The final step is paying food for each castle. If a player doesn't have enough food, a game piece has to be taken away.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player that completes his turn and mission card.&#10;&#10;What makes the game interesting is the dilemma of being mutually dependent of your co player. Meanwhile each player wants to become independent by building your own workshops. For this you first need to negotiate with your co players. Becoming independent is often not on the road to completing you mission. So should you remain dependent and try to reach you goal asap, while running the risk of being blocked in the end, or should you try to become independent first and strong en your influence.&#10;Another element of influence in the game is the Mill. There is only one mill in the game. If someone else builds the mill, you lose it. Having the mill means controlling the food. You can use this position to get extra income or by starving and deterioration you opponents. Partner or Compete.&#10;&#10;Another element is the game of positioning:  &#10;A workshop has to border a Castle. A small castle can have 2 workshops and a big castle can have 4 workshops. The castle has to be positioned between the 4 8-sided landscapes. Getting a good position with the correct landscapes around your castle is important. However, you opponents can block you by building farms, witchery or a workshop adjacent to your castle.&#10;&#10;As an extra the game contains two additions in the manual which will strongly change the game. The first addition is the option to steal a farm if it isn't protected by an own castle or witchery. The second addition is to steal workshop by building a stronger castle.&#10;&#10;All in all a very good balanced game, with a lot of dynamic and a great replayability.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p9S6h_QXpCsiC4K_zMNoyg__original/img/qTIwXhk1fWbZ9OEKgD-K6EYfLy8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic893330.png', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The use of FACs keeps the action moving along at a pace simulating the real sport.&#10;&#10;All of the action comes from the players&rsquo; cards with no chart lookups needed. In ITP, each player will have 3 columns per card showing regular offense, offensive rebound and fastbreak sections. In each section the players frequency of 2/3 FGA, drawing fouls, turnovers and assists come into play. For the Dennis Rodman types when the offense does come his way a simple PASS may be the outcome. Each player has separate GOTO ratings where the more they are involved in the offense the better chance you will see him be called upon to make a play. You often see players that don't have great offensive stats (FG%, TO) but these are often guys that have to create offense. If you don't have a any offensive weapons (good or bad) on the floor then you will see the offense bog down in ITP.&#10;&#10;Defense in ITP is not an afterthought and is intertwined into the game at all points. Players are rated separately for steals, blocks, committing fouls and overall defense. A special DENY rating for defensive players works with the aforementioned GOTO ratings where good defenders can actually keep a player from being able to take an action on the court. The defensive ratings come into play in what are called possible defensive stops. There are special notations on the FACs that can possibly stop an offensive action or affect a shot.&#10;&#10;ITP keeps the action moving with a fastbreak system that is simple yet effective to use. The run-and-gun style teams will feel that way as will the plodders. Each player gets a fastbreak rating that shows his propensity to get out on the break and, when he does, his card has a column just for that event.&#10;&#10;The special Momentum Factor (*MOM) is built into the FACs and either gives a team a boost or causes them to miss some shots. The use of timeouts can readjust this factor and keep the game on an even keel but you must use them wisely as timeouts can be very useful towards the end of a game allowing you to call plays and get extra time when you may need it. Managing timeouts can be very challenging. If you use too many timeouts for momentum swings then you will be limited to using your TO's for subs and especially late in a very close game when you want to call a designed play to a specific player. However, not calling timeouts on a momentum run can cause the game to get out of control, thus hurting a teams' chances to win.&#10;&#10;So, if basketball is your game, get out of your seat and get Inside the Paint!&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VoP9RnqwNbJ9YmBcQNIG-A__original/img/qxN2UjzUWotjlEqU7Z6WbG4w_bY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic611635.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The game contents consist of a deck of 70 cards, each illustrated in a &lsquo;70s/&lsquo;80s retro art style, and a rule sheet, attractively packaged in a small black cardboard box.  Most of what you need to know is printed on the cards themselves and makes picking up and getting into the game very easy.  The use of icons on the cards, representing different aspects of the game (e.g. the discard pile, the play area and your hand of cards), makes the game even easier to understand.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2 to 6 players of ages 7 and up.  Games can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 30 minutes to play - depending on the experience of players and the number of players in each game.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the first player with 100 points down on the table, which isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.  Players have cards that can steal cards you have tabled or send them to the discard pile.  So you need to be able to judge the best time to put cards on the table and how to defend your cards once they are down.&#10;&#10;Game-play is highly interactive and the base rules are simple to follow to make it accessible to casual and non-gamers as well as dedicated gamers.  At the start of play, each person is dealt a hand of five cards.  These cards each have values clearly printed on them, ranging from negative amounts to a maximum of 20 points.  They also have actions printed on them, along with a graphic (which features some pun on vision such as &lsquo;wink&rsquo; or &lsquo;blind spot&rsquo;).  The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.&#10;&#10;While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.&#10;&#10;The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-MfnKReEK0hVXLI4G2xtAg__original/img/w44T5xtR9Bdnb647LqHkqz5xWqI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic611307.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

So, if you remember which knights are hidden on the counters you move, you can i.e. move a strong enemy knight towards another player, or a good knight toward you and/or far from other players.&#10;&#10;Armour repair can be done in two ways: finding the counter representing the Gold Kinght of Aries, or passing through the Temple of Aries, located in the center of the top-level board.&#10;&#10;Each of the three pieces of the board can be rotated before being placed, so the whole board can have a few different configurations.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hxg1ieQh-0sBdU7mPwdIfg__original/img/7gq9jDE2yFcdoC3ReYZ1IgSz868=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic613172.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Battles in SuperSystem can involve as few as two models per side, or as many as ten to thirty models per side. There are two basic types of models in SuperSystem: characters and henchmen. Characters are the heroes and villains that make up the superhuman population of Four-Color Earth, the fictional setting of the game. Henchmen are their underlings, goons, mooks, or cannon fodder. Although some henchmen can also possess superhuman powers, they never rise to levels of the characters.&#10;&#10;Players may fight SuperSystem battles as one-off encounters, or as extended campaigns where their heroes and villains develop unique personalities, gain new abilities, and sometimes suffer grievous injuries.

Points are scored at the end of the game based on the number of planets they scanned and claimed, and their combination of resources collected.

Resource cards are distributed:  1 face-up to each player, 1 face-up to each planet, and the rest are distributed face-down amongst the planets.&#10;&#10;Players are each given 5 NavComp cards and the rest of the NavComp cards are set as a draw deck in the middle of the table.  Each NavComp card contains 2 codes (used to take some of the standard actions) and possibly a special action.&#10;&#10;Players take turns around the table.  On a player's turn, he/she takes 2 actions in any order, and may select from the following actions:  Research (refill hand), Fly (move to neighboring planet), Jump (use the Jump Gate to move to another Planet), Scan (reveal a resource at a planet), Land &amp; Claim (claim a planet and reveal all resources there), Harvest (collect a resource), and Special Action.  Special actions include being able to scan a far-away planet, harvest extra resources, swap locations with another player, etc.&#10;&#10;When players &quot;Jump&quot;, they add one of their markers to the Jump Gate Board.  The player with the most markers on the Jump Gate Board at the end of the game gains an extra 5 points.  If a player collects a Resource that has a &quot;Black Hole&quot; icon on it, a marker is added to the Black Hole Board.  If too many markers get added to that board, the game ends and the player with the most markers on the Black Hole Board loses some of his/her collected Resources.  The game can also end when all non-Black-Hole Resources have been collected from all of the planets.&#10;&#10;Scoring is done at the end of the game, and players are awarded points for Scanning and Claiming Planets, as well as for the combination of Resources they had collected.

He just needed a victory to cast the entire war in an a new strategic light.&#10;&#10;All could very well be decided by what happens in the western part of Maryland over a few days.&#10;&#10;McClellan fought Lee's army back to the banks of the Antietam creek near the town of Sharpsburg. There both armies stood to fight the bloodiest single day battle in American history. The final decision is in your hands.&#10;&#10;None but Heroes is a game about that terrible day. Players tackle each other head-on. Can you do better than McClellan? Can you fight McClellan off like Lee? The stakes couldn't be higher!&#10;&#10;None but Heroes is the first game in the new Line of Battle Series. While drawing on the lessons of over 20 years of ACW design work of its two ancestor series, LoB represents the next generation of ACW game design. No stone was left unturned in making this system the best gaming experience possible. All the unit rosters and paperwork that interfered with the fighting is gone. The typical (and time consuming) multiple fire phases have all been integrated into movement so the action is non-stop.&#10;&#10;For the first time, the rat fight feel of the ACW open battlefield comes alive. The historical units (generally regiments of infantry and batteries of cannon) actually show the combined arms interactions and tactics available at the time. Old hands will see the history in a new light as they explore the implications of more recent research.&#10;&#10;Representing many years of original research, the game contains information not available anywhere else regarding the strength, equipment, location, capabilities, and order of battle of both armies. Extensive historical notes layout just some of the myriad of details included in the units, scenarios, and map.&#10;&#10;As one small example, it explores the frequently overlooked &quot;Green&quot; units at the battle (units which have been in the army for a few weeks or even less). The Green units will make you look at McClellan's strength in a whole new way. This is a level of &quot;greenness&quot; well beyond the usual sense of &quot;not having been in combat, yet&quot;. These are enthusiastic men, but some of whom have not yet been taught to load their muskets.&#10;&#10;The Union player is only mildly inhibited by his McClellan persona; you can try a lot of different approaches to cutting the Rebels down to size. You are equipped with the same heavy guns and infantry with just as much grit and determination as he was.&#10;&#10;The Confederate player will need to use his thin forces wisely, but cannot fail to counterattack as needed to blunt Union advances. You must use your troop's elan to make up for their limited numbers.&#10;&#10;The game features four two-map scenarios which allow players to pick up the action at various times during the day and the morning of the next. The ability to start play the day after the battle allows players a chance to explore the options available on that day. Each of the other three scenarios can alternatively be played as a two day campaign game.&#10;&#10;In addition to the large scenarios above, there are four smaller scenarios involving only portions of one map. One is a very short learning scenario showing the charge of Hood's Texans into the Cornfield. The other three isolate key actions of the battle: The complete Cornfield fight, the Battle for the Sunken Road, and the final attack by Burnside to take Sharpsburg and the counterattack by A.P. Hill's Division.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tVLUf7uiZQ4kFDlzRxrAeA__original/img/5G2VRz1x5_AZAR7LqnyhPFpu5Ac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic960574.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

In the 16th century, alchemists made attempts to do that in their laboratories, aspiring to gain wealth and never-ending fame. Some, as Edward Kelley, thanks to royal sponsors, achieved all that, nevertheless they never succeeded in transmutation of metals&hellip; In this magical game that you are holding it&rsquo;s very simple. &#10;Build a laboratory and collect the necessary components. And transformation of metals? If you manage to adjust to the changing moods of the Spirit of Transmutation, then it&rsquo;s really not complicated at all. So, what is the game about? You have competition in your town &ndash; other alchemists who also know the right technology. Only the one of you who is the most efficient will win recognition and fame. It will surely last until the next game, or, who knows, perhaps eternally&hellip;&#10;&#10;Players will try to be the most effective alchemist.&#10;To achieve that they will need to build buildings, represented by cards. In these buildings, they will acquire resources, transform them into gold and finally sell them for victory points or cards. Selling gold isn't only way to win the game.&#10;&#10;Game is using Rondel mechanic to pick an action by players and hand management, where cards represent buildings, currency and resources.&#10;&#10;Alchemicus was designed as a family game with little negative interaction. Requests planning but also concentrating on other players movements and predicting them. Many beginners forget it, being focused on their own technology structure, so very often they fall behind. We think that this game style can be useful for teaching young players to think beyond their own needs. Anyway, the game is not for kids. The youngest of our testers who was able to win the play against his father was 12 years old (consider that his father is lawyer, so probably he is quite smart ;))) hahaha one of them. Father or son. we are not sure which one :D).&#10;Because the factor of negative interaction is not very strong the play goes ahead in a nice atmosphere which is fun for family play.&#10;Older players can play a bit differently, by using the position of The Transmutation Ghost to foil your opponents' plans. This strategy can be counteracted by defending yourself with buildings and goods in circulation which are resistant to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5fkGYCsvO-WoJXko7kbfuQ__original/img/wkZLBjgjPkcAA1Fb9pY9DdbdJd4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic615878.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Be wary of flying dragons, defending flag bearers, and the castle&rsquo;s move-restricting levels. A fantastical world where a modern twist on the classic game of chess feeds the eternal feud between King Ulric and King Montfort, the realm of C&amp;C is a place that knows no grandmasters and players enjoy the luxury of an entirely new endgame&hellip; what's your endgame?&#10; Game Rules&#10;&#10;Playing Crusade &amp; Conquer is similar to chess... well kind of.  While many of the characters and their movements mirror classic chess,  the new board, castles, and game pieces have introduced twists and turns that will make even the most strategic and advanced players think twice.   But this game is not just for the masters.  Anyone can learn... and once you do you'll never turn back.&#10;The Castle&#10;&#10;The Castle has two levels or floors. The upper level is where the King and Queen begin the game; with the King always starting on the X. Remember, the game is lost if the opposing Flag Bearer reaches your King&rsquo;s starting X.&#10;&#10;Game pieces cannot jump up or down more than one level in a single movement and must stop their movement as soon as a level is traversed. There are two exceptions to this rule:&#10;&#10;&bull;Castle Exception #1: the Knight is allowed to complete the L-shape movement as long as it only moves one level per turn. If the Knight must move up two levels to complete its L-shape movement, the move is not allowed.&#10;&bull;Castle Exception #2: because it can &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, the Dragon&rsquo;s movements in and around the Castle are not restricted. However, the Dragon can only move more than one space in a single turn if it is flying over teammates.&#10;&#10;Dragons&#10;&#10;A Dragon may move one space per turn in any direction. A Dragon may jump its teammates in any direction for as many spaces as they are in a straight line. A Dragon cannot jump opposing game pieces, even if they are between teammates. With the exception of the Flag Bearer, a Dragon may kill any opposing game piece by moving in any direction. A Dragon may also kill any opposing game pieces (except the Flag Bearer) by jumping teammates to complete the move. A Dragon must end its move as soon as it kills an opposing game piece. A Dragon may traverse more than one level of The Castle in a single move only if it is jumping over teammates.&#10;&#10;Flag Bearers&#10;&#10;A Flag Bearer may only move one diagonal space per turn. A Flag Bearer cannot jump teammates or opposing game pieces to complete a move. A Flag Bearer cannot kill any opposing game pieces but can only be killed by the opposing King. A Flag Bearer must end its move as soon as it traverses a level of The Castle. A Flag Bearer can win the game by reaching an opposing King&rsquo;s starting position.&#10;&#10;&#10;Winning Crusade &amp; Conquer&#10;&#10;There are two potential endgames (ways to win the game) in Crusade &amp; Conquer. The first endgame is to kill the opposing King. The second endgame is to get your Flag Bearer into the opposing King&rsquo;s starting position (the opposing X).&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RYbEJGC7rs-C2ftFZAMa1g__original/img/8svfVG2kC4Jl2SX_Wu4eX_W8Eao=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic620348.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Players can still move through other UMVees, but doing so costs battery power, and managing your batteries&mdash;which allow extra actions&mdash;is another important aspect of playing well.&#10;&#10;Undermining comes with a double-sided game board, with player interaction being significantly different from one side to the other. With a random layout of resources, UMVee upgrades, contract variability, and one-off special bonuses from the finding of alien technology, no two games of Undermining are ever the same.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 5, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/waxOKvc1smlGRqarTf6etQ__original/img/8IqNpAWB9EvCecFfzYfyPI38xb4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1069095.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Beyond these basics, 1817 introduces several additional financial mechanics such as short selling, market driven interest rates, hostile takeovers, and corporate liquidations. The most unique is selling stock short. Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don&rsquo;t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date. You hope to profit from a decline in the price of the stock between the sale and the repurchase. Conversely, you will incur a loss if the price of the stock increases before the repurchase.

A hand typically consists of playing one of your cards into the centre as an 'Ante' card, then three rounds of card-playing, attempting to play the best set (or 'Flight') of cards. The highest value Ante card determines the amount of gold that every player must contribute to the pot this round. The player who played the highest value Ante card starts the first round. Subsequent rounds are started by the player who played the highest value card in the previous round. Each card has both a numerical value and a power (or ability). However, the power is only triggered if the card has a lower or equal value to the card just played.&#10;&#10;The game is a balance between playing high cards to win the pot of gold in the Ante and playing lower cards to trigger their abilities and improve your hand for a later round.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by itself, or in combination with the original Three-Dragon Ante card set.&#10;&#10;From WoTC site:&#10;This fun card game updates the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game, adding new cards and new ways to foil your opponents!

By the fall of 1861, both Union and Confederate forces occupied Kentucky and, despite the fact that the state had not seceded from the Union, the Confederate States of America had set up a temporary state capital in Bowling Green, installed a governor and added a star representing the state to its flag.  Not surprisingly, a campaign to wrest control of the state from the Union, the &ldquo;Confederate Heartland Offensive,&rdquo; was launched by Generals Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg in the summer of 1862.&#10;&#10;The small town of Perryville, located in the central portion of the state, was an unlikely site for the culmination of the campaign, but as the Union forces of General Don Carlos Buell pursued Bragg's Army of the Mississippi eastward under severe drought conditions in early October, both sides made their way to the town in search of the water promised by the Chaplin River and its tributaries.  Once the forces collided near Doctor's Creek on October 8, the Battle of Perryville, the biggest battle fought in Kentucky and, for the number of soldiers involved, one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, had begun.&#10;&#10;By nightfall, the Confederates had scored a tactical victory, as Bragg&rsquo;s army had managed to push Buell&rsquo;s forces back over a mile, but both sides had suffered extensive casualties (over 6,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were dead, wounded, captured or missing), and Bragg, having realized that the number of Union forces in Perryville had been greatly underestimated, would withdraw from the town that night as part of what would ultimately be a total withdrawal from the state.  (Kentucky remained in the Union column for the remainder of the war.)  Buell, roundly criticized for his failures in leadership during the battle (including his failure, due in part to a phenomenon known as an &ldquo;acoustic shadow,&rdquo; to recognize the severity of the battle until very late in the engagement and, therefore, to provide needed &ndash; and readily-available &ndash; reinforcements), found his military career effectively ruined at Perryville despite his strategic victory there.&#10;&#10;Perryville:  Bragg vs. Buell, Oct. 8, 1862, a card-driven war game, gives two players the chance to step into the shoes of these generals.

Typically, the black meeples (and blue die for variant) are used by the groom whereas the white 'farmers' (and pink die) are for the bride. You must jump your partner whenever possible.

It is intended to be played with 1/600 scale miniatures, although conversions to other scales would be relatively straightforward.&#10;&#10;Hammerin' Iron 2 is a set of rules designed to covers river conflicts of the American Civil War, 1861 to 1865.&#10;&#10;This rules system uses a hex movement system that is described as original to Peter Pig.  This system requires that each ship miniature be placed upon a 5.5&quot; hexagon cutout.  The hexagons are used as a 'floating' hex grid radiating from each ship miniature.  These hexes offer the ease of a hex grid in regulating movement, but since rotations of odd angles (for example, 34 or 52 degrees rotation) are possible, this system is free of the constraints of a traditional grid which would limit ships to 60 degree rotations.&#10;&#10;Combat is based on a dice-pool system, in which to-hit modifiers affect the number of dice rolled. Each dice result of 5 or 6 (on a d6) is a potential hit, which is then tested against armor deflection. Potential hits not successfully deflected score hull hits.&#10;&#10;A major change in this rules system compared to the first edition is the omission of the ship schematics and crew counters (in which individual crew counters were moved about the ship to allocate crew to various ship functions).  However, if one views Hammerin' Iron 2 as an &quot;expansion&quot; rather than &quot;rewrite&quot;, then one is open to include the crew and schematic rules from 1st edition in the Hammerin' Iron 2 rules.&#10;&#10;Equipment (in addition to the rules) required for play include:&#10;&#10;     Ship models (1/600 scale preferred)&#10;     approximately 12 hexagons cut from 5.5-inch plastic or cardboard circles&#10;     approximately 16 six-sided dice&#10;     cardstock or felt cutouts to represent sandbars, shallows, shorelines etc&#10;     cotton (white or black) to represent damage to ships&#10;     notepaper and pencil&#10;     order cards (can be cut from rulebook, or alternatively prepared from cardstock)&#10;&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 0, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPxR1EK5aFZc1aKOx0_Nvw__original/img/sWMY3kwocG1PlUJaC4VjyHwq8O4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1093368.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Step by step the detectives follow the murderer's trail, carefully checking each trace, searching out anyone in any way connected with the case. The witnesses (once identified) are ready to testify. Their statements may help or further complicate the process of investigation. In this game everything depends on the deductive skills of the players: no one else will put together all the pieces of the puzzle into one coherent and logical picture.  And even when (and if) the criminal is finally caught (after the exciting chase phase of the game), it&rsquo;s not over yet: the detectives try to deduct the motive of the crime, reconstruct the entire story from the scraps of data they have managed to collect.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 5, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8nJKGbZZ1WCOYm2B8yBIfQ__original/img/QF1SEznx6fvw45wg4HIdG_Mf7Ug=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic632269.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

After several small clashes, the biggest battle of the campaign came not against Villa's Division del Norte, but another force also on Villa's trail: the Mexican Federal Army.&#10;&#10;Just what happened at Carrizal in June 1916 is not clear: Mexican and American accounts vary wildly.  What is clear is that two dozen American cavalrymen were taken prisoner and up to 50 soldiers on both sides were killed including the &quot;Hero of Carrizal,&quot; the 29-year-old Mexican commander Gen. Felix Uresti Gomez. Only the looming war in Europe prevented open war between the two North American nations.&#10;&#10;The Chihuahua Incident is a stand-alone game in the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the four scenarios. The game is designed as a preview of the Infantry Attacks system for our hard-core fans, the Gold Club members. It includes a handful of small scenarios taking place on one game board &mdash; one based on the actual battle of Carrizal (or at least our reading of the different versions) with the others based on hypothetical variations that show the game system's take on infantry and cavalry battles.&#10;&#10;The game includes the pre-release edition of the new series rules and charts, which may be altered before the release of the first boxed game, Infantry Attacks: August 1914.  The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor are the maps and rules printed. Instead it comes as a collection of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.

The World Cup Card Game allows players to play through the whole tournament in around 75mins.&#10;The game consists of 65 cards. 32 of these represent all the national teams taking part. Another 32 cards are Action cards which are used to create the scorelines for each match. The final card is a summary list of what the Action cards can be used for.&#10;&#10;All the teams are randomly divided between the players. These are kept face-down on the table in front of the player until required.&#10;&#10;Each group is played match by match. The players controlling the four teams in Group 1: South Africa, Mexico, Uruguay and France now reveal those Team cards.&#10;&#10;Each team card is coloured according to the national football team strip, it also shows the national flag and a note stating their best performance ever achieved in any World Cup tournament. There is also a grey rectangle with the number of cards that team receives in the group stage - this is always 7 or 8. There is also a 2 Goal and 3 Goal symbol, sometimes covered by a cross. Any crossed symbol means that this particular team cannot use that type of card to it's full potential e.g, Argentina have the 3 Goal symbol crossed but the 2 Goal symbol uncrossed, therefore Argentina can only play a 3 Goal card as a 2 Goal card.&#10; The number of cards and the status of the 3 and 2 goal symbols distinguishes the better teams from the lesser teams. Brazil, for example, have 8 cards and no crossed symbols which gives them the maximum options; New Zealand have 7 cards and both symbols are crossed which gives them the fewest options. Despite the small difference between the various teams, the better teams generally have a better chance. However, the differences are not as great as in The World Cup Board Game.&#10;Play continues with the first group games being played in the order on the tournament format in the rules. The first game is South Africa v. Mexico, so each player controlling those teams play from 1 to 4 cards out of that teams' hand. The number of cards should be kept secret until both players have chosen, then they are both revealed. Goals are scored for that team in that match, Defences, Fouls and Offsides can reduce goals whereas Penalties and multiple Attacks add goals. Any spare Attacks and penalties require a card draw from the unused deck to see if they can be turned into goals.&#10;&#10;Each match is resolved in the same way. All scores from all games are recorded - best to use the pre-formatted scoresheet on the www.gamesfortheworld.co.uk/Downloads web page.&#10;&#10;The KO stages are played differently, more akin to the Board game. The Round of 16 is split into 2 sessions with 3 cards dealt to each player involved, irrespective of the number of teams. Cards can be played on any active team until the deck is exhausted and all cards played.&#10;&#10;From the Quarter-Finals onwards all games are played in each round simultaneously.&#10;Draws are resolved by card draws to determine if goals have been scored.&#10;&#10;Easy to play and a great sequel to the Board game.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 8, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y2Oorl9giqmEmChJeXHniQ__original/img/G2gaEd74S3DRZ_iBmdESL9bchuY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic681137.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

If you choose a windmill tile, you place it on an empty space adjacent to a space already containing a tile. All tiles have a victory point number (some are zero).

(2nd Edition)$$, $$On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.&#10;&#10;The opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.&#10;&#10;From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.&#10;&#10;A las Barricadas!

It belongs to the Morris family. Like other games from that family, its origins date back to antiquity. The game is played by nomadic shepherds and city dwellers where a class of professional players has emerged.&#10;&#10;Shax is played on the same board as Nine Men's Morris, but with twelve pieces for each player. Play consists of two phases: the setup phase and the movement phase. In the setup phase, players take turns putting one piece on the board. Unlike in Nine Men's Morris, no pieces are removed when a jare (three-in-a-row, mill, literally: &quot;cut&quot;) is formed during the setup. It is only noted who formed the first jare.&#10;&#10;In the movement phase, the player who formed the first jare moves first (if no jare was formed in the setup phase, the second player starts). He does so by removing one arbitrary piece of the opponent in order to create space for movement. The opponent does the same. Then players take turns moving their stones as in the other Morris games.&#10;&#10;If a jare is formed in the movement phase, the player removes a piece of the opponent. Note that - again unlike other Morris games - pieces in a jare are never protected against capture. Another important difference is that blocking does not constitute a win. If a player is locked in, he may demand that the opponent moves his stones until the blockade is removed. No advantage may be taken from these extra moves. In particular, if a jare is formed during these moves, then no capture is performed. There is no &quot;flying phase&quot; when a player is reduced to three pieces or less. The player who loses all his pieces loses the game.&#10;&#10;Numerous references to Shax exist in proverbs and Somalian literature. Favorable patterns of stones have got their own names.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zXrGXIy3RMZOWC7FCHmgfw__original/img/ahoUWezQ6JgMB_bU8ZiAj7xzM38=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4808638.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.&#10;Historically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.&#10;&#10;The overall 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&quot;x42&quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map. The main map is divided into four areas: Blue Beach, Dieppe town, Green Beach and Rear. Each hex represents 400 meters (438 yards) across; each game turn equals 20 minutes. Units of maneuver are companies and batteries; there are 176 large-size NATO-style and iconic counters in the mix.&#10; Rules cover such things as: coastal battery fire, random events, unit depth, command-control and communication, air attack, &ldquo;what if&rdquo; variants, amphibious warfare and much more. The game can be completed in about three to four hours. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. CW Amphibious Transport Phase&#10;1. Unit Transport&#10;2. Landing Check&#10;II. Operations Phase&#10;III. Commonwealth Action Phase&#10;1. Beach Landings or Evacuation.&#10;2. CW Actions&#10;3. Recovery&#10;IV.

Combining large-scale map movement with a fast-play set of tactical rules, the game lets players follow a convoy from embarkation to destination in a single play session.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;map game&quot;, convoys move in eight-hour operational turns, rolling for engagements with U-boats, blockade runners, raiders, and even weather. A large-scale map and tables generate one or more events each turn. Some events are resolved immediately with a few die rolls. Others, such as attacjs by U-boats or raiders are resolved with the fast-play tactical rules.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Atlantic is broken down into several areas and periods, each covered in a seperate map/game module. Deadly Waters is the first such module, covering the Gibraltar Run from January 1941 through December 1942. Each module includes a CD-ROM with full-color damage cards for all the ships and subs needed for convoy battles in that period.&#10;&#10;Convoy will be supported by other map games currently under development. These cover other parts of the Battle of the Atlantic as well as the desperate Murmansk/Soviet lifeline. Designed by Mal Wright, the game system incorporates Mal's thorough research of published sources including interviews with veterans from both sides of the conflict, and illustrates the operational realities of the Battle of the Atlantic.&#10;&#10;Both the map game booklets and tactical rules emphasize simplicity and fast play. Accompanied by sidebars and historical background, they are an excellent introduction for a gamer new to naval warfare, or one who wants to deepen his understanding of this critical naval campaign.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cA-den51R1wUpIzaaiKB5Q__original/img/ZX0C--IhW5eqFIrXeYWKQKF49s0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic701543.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Whenever you first land on an X, you take a VP token worth a number of points equal to that track's number. If you are already on an X and roll that number again, you take another token. Only one playing piece can be on an X; if someone else lands on an X that you occupy, you remove your playing piece from the board and can start down that track again later.&#10;&#10;If you collect one token of each value (5-10), you take a bonus card, with the first being worth 15 VPs and the others worth 12, 9 and 6.

The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.&#10;&#10;The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect.

The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. They fight so hard in fact that an army general is sacked because of the toughness of the Japanese defenses.  The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.&#10;&#10;The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect.

One GET OUT! card can be played on top of another GET OUT! card - to cancel a previous call or to keep it the same.&#10;&#10;7. Players do not have to play a card even if they are able to, but they must pick up a card from the draw pile. This might happen when player is playing defensively.&#10;&#10;8.

July 12 in Ireland has become a day of pride and anger, lawsuits and fisticuffs. Called &ldquo;The Twelfth,&rdquo; it commemorates the Battle of the Boyne, 1690, when William of Orange (hence today&rsquo;s Protestant &ldquo;Orangemen&rdquo;) and his polyglot army ended the Jacobite hopes for James II to regain the throne and allow (at least) more religious freedom for Catholic Ireland.&#10;&#10;In one sense, The Boyne might be considered the last battle of the English Civil War&mdash;a conflict that had spilled into both Scotland and Ireland along the way. And it might be considered one of the last battles of the Protestant Reformation, since much support on both sides had to do with which religion other countries wished to prevail, which is evident when you find that William&rsquo;s army included Danes, Dutch, English, Huguenots, Welsh and Protestant Irish. James&rsquo; army was mostly Catholic Irish but also included a brigade of crack French infantry and some of the best cavalry in Europe.&#10;&#10;The Boyne also represents a key transition point in military technology&hellip;the last of the matchlocks and pikes and first of the flintlocks, a final time when cavalry caracole competed with pressing home a charge&#10;&#10;So what&rsquo;s with &lsquo;Lillibulero&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a song that was a popular tune before this time but became locked with the whole Irish campaign. Trust us, you have heard the tune. It used to be used by the BBC, various British army groups, and the movie Barry Lyndon, and has been featured in alternative lyrics versions for several wars since&mdash;including the ACW and WW2&mdash;and in Ulster folk tunes. It was &ldquo;said to have sung James II out of three kingdoms,&rdquo; and is still part of the Orange marches mentioned above.&#10;&#10;What about the game? Philip Jelley&rsquo;s design brings us area movement for the broad area of eastern Ireland relevant to the battle, with units representing the various regiments, battalions, squadrons, and batteries that fought in the battle. Each turn represents roughly one hour of time, with weather, mist, and gunsmoke affecting command and control and unit activations. Scenarios are included for the full battle with historical deployments, the full battle with free-set-up, and for specific parts of the battle (for shorter playtime). Also included is a smaller battle &ldquo;delaying action&rdquo; that some people say is what James should have done, plus, there are optional rules for units who could have been involved or who had pressing reasons to NOT be involved (Even William might not be there!). You&rsquo;ll have plenty of chances to try various ways of heading off &ldquo;The Troubles&rdquo; of three centuries ago, or of pressing William&rsquo;s claims and making a truly &ldquo;United Kingdom.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Map - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet (plus a second half-sized map covering the battle of Aughrim)&#10;Counters - 176 full color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;Rules length - 12 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;Complexity - Low&#10;Solitaire suitability - Low&#10;Playing time - Up to 3 hours&#10;&#10;Design - Philip Jelley&#10;Development - Lembit Tohver&#10;Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 2, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MIckzO4VqhE2hRujVkBJkA__original/img/9xwyCM70hlHlmUVhERpQ6ZbJaYs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1378785.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour. The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period (A.D. 98-180) of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines.

Players control factions, each one controlling senators, consuls, proconsuls, provinces, legions, fleets, courtiers and trade concessions. One faction controls the Caesar, who can reward and punish, wage war and make peace and takes the cream of Rome&rsquo;s wealth. Every hand is raised against him and to claim victory he must survive assassinations, rebellions and the attentions of the Praetorian Guard. Foreign wars interfere with internal politics, the expansion of the empire leads to great glory and renown, but Germanic tribes and Parthian kings may invade at any time and the generals sent to repel them may march on Rome to claim the imperial purple. If the players place the good of the Rome before their own ambitions it may expand beyond its historical limits, if not they could precipitate its premature decline and fall.&#10;&#10;$$, 1, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kzARCTOC2m9tELWbKD2I0Q__original/img/-hEYw4_hZfRyXJg_mzZ_rhTRG5A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic634035.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

When natural calamities repeatedly occurred, it was clear that the old regime had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Then the reigning monarch, facing the inevitable, should elect the wisest and most virtuous man to replace him, so as to make the change of dynasties a peaceful transformation.

King, Lords and Commons, landlords and merchants, the City and the countryside, bishops and presbyters, the Scottish army, the Welsh people, and the English Fleet, all now turned against the New Model Army. The Army beat the lot.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sir Winston Churchill&#10;&#10;The New Model Army was created by Parliament in 1645 to defeat the armies of King Charles I in the 1st Civil War. As Lord-General they chose Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had little interest in politics, but his second-in-command was Oliver Cromwell, already a leading member of the Independent Party in Parliament. As a military machine the New Model did all that was desired of it. They beat the Royalists at the Battles of Naseby and Langport, besieged his capital of Oxford and in 1646 Charles surrendered. Parliament needed to reach an accommodation with the King for a Settlement of the Kingdom, but he refused to yield any of his Royal Prerogatives. Secretly, he negotiated with Irish Catholics, Scottish Presbyterians and English Radicals, anyone who could return him to power.&#10;&#10;By 1647 agitators elected by the Army rank and file were expressing increasingly radical politics and under Cromwell it had become a haven for religious independents. Parliament proposed to ship troublesome regiments to Ireland, disband others without payment of arrears and establish a Presbyterian Church to suppress religious dissent. In response the Army kidnapped the king and marched on London. Their opponents fled and the Army began its own fruitless negotiations with Charles, but he had other plans; he made an Engagement with the Scottish Duke of Hamilton, promising a Presbyterian Church in England if they restored him to power. In the spring of 1648 Hamilton began to recruit a 36,000 army to invade England,  the Parliamentarian armies in Munster and Wales declared for the King, the Cavalier Sir Marmaduke Langdale seized the border fortresses of Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle, the Navy mutinied, there were pro-Royalist riots across England and major rebellions broke out in Kent and Essex.&#10;&#10;On 30th April 1648 the Army Council met at Windsor Castle for a three day prayer meeting where they decided &quot;that it was the duty of our day, with the forces we had, to go out and fight against those potent enemies&quot;. Despite being outnumbered two, three or even four to one the New Model Army beat the Welsh at St Fagans, the Royalists at Maidstone and Colchester and the Scots at Preston. The victorious regiments occupied Edinburgh and London, purged Parliament and brought &quot;Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood he had shed&quot;. They tried him waging war on his people, cut off his head and proclaimed a republic.&#10;&#10;Man of Blood is an area movement and impulse game for two to four players recreating the Second Civil War of 1648, the direct cause of the English Revolution and the execution of Charles I. The first player controls the New Model Army; the second the Parliamentarian Northern Association, Irish Army, Scottish Whigs, some lukewarm militia and a mutinous fleet; the third has a loose alliance of Cavaliers, Presbyterians, Welsh, and any ships that desert the Parliamentarians, and the fourth the Scots Engagers and Ulster Army. The Royalists and Scots have more men, but worse generals and variable reinforcements. Players manoeuvre their forces from area to area across the map in order to destroy enemy regiments, capture towns, build up a navy and control the King. It has a 34 by 22 inch map depicting 17th Century Britain from the English Channel to the Highlands and 280 half-inch counters representing the generals, admirals, regiments and warships that fought the war.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c9V5jVW7jPUkQPCEV1Mv4g__original/img/O8REG-PrFxrJ2Au3FGZumm5KZm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1371502.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

The number of points needed would be dependent upon how much time could be allotted for the game. A quick game could be played up to 100 points. A greater point total would be set for a more in-depth game experience.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;1. Each player must roll one die. Whoever gets the highest roll selects a playing piece and places it on a Mission Card Spot. The player with the next highest roll chooses next. This continues until everyone has placed their piece. Note: Players do not get to draw a Mission Card at this time.&#10;&#10;2. The player who placed their piece last gets to play first. This follows until the player who placed their piece goes last.&#10;&#10;3. The players roll two dice. When the game begins the players must decide which way they will be travelling. On following turns they must continue the direction they were travelling on the previous round. The players may choose to stop moving at any time during their turn. For example, if a player rolls five on the dice, but only need three to get to a Question Spot, they may cease movement on the Spot.&#10;&#10;4. The direction of movement cannot be changed until one of the following has occurred: the player lands on a Question Spot; the player lands on a Mission Card Spot; or the player has a Mission Card that allows reversal of motion.&#10;&#10;5. Players must land on question spots to be asked questions. The answers will be presented in a multiple-choice format. When a question is answered correctly, the player recieves the number of points printed on the card. The person who moved previously acts as the questioner. If this happens on the first turn, the player who goes last asks the question. The questioner draws a Question Card corresponding to the map grid and the color landed on by the player. There are three levels of difficulty for answering questions.&#10;&#10;Level One: Beginning learners would play for the full point total and would have the multiple choice answers read to them.&#10;&#10;Level Two: Intermediate play would have the most options; the learner can answer the question for full points by not having the multiple choice answers read to them and for half points if they need to have their answer options read to them.&#10;&#10;Level Three: Advanced learners would play for the full point total without having the multiple choice answers read to them.&#10;&#10;6. If the player does not answer the question correctly, the remaining players may attempt to jump in and steal the question. If they answer correctly, they gain half the points that the original player would have recieved. If they answer incorrectly, they lose half of the points the original player would have recieved. All other remaining players may attempt this with the exception of the Questioner.&#10;&#10;7. After successfully answering a question, the player must move to another map grid before stopping at another Question Spot. This does not apply to players who jumped in on someone else's question.&#10;&#10;8. When the players land on a Mission Card spot, they get to draw one Mission card. Some Mission Cards may be saved for later and others must be played immediately. The card should state when it comes into effect.&#10;&#10;9. The game concludes at a predetermined win scenario. The game can be played towards a point limit. For example, the first player with 100 points could be the winner. Alternately, the game can be played to a time limit. PLay could be set to end in 30 minutes and whoever has the most points would be the winner.&#10;&#10;$$, 2, 4, '', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Draw the card that corresponds to the color space you landed&#10;on. Follow instructions on the card. If you run out of cards for a color&#10;that space becomes a &ldquo;roll-again&rdquo; space.&#10;Winning and Ending the Game&#10;The game ends when a player lands on the finish space. You must land&#10;exactly in the finish space. For example if you are four spaces away&#10;from finish you must roll a four or less to progress further. If they roll&#10;higher their turn has ended.&#10;When the game ends all the players count the cards they have in each&#10;category. For each card category that a player has the most cards they&#10;get one point. The player who reached the finish first also receives one&#10;point. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;$$, 3, 6, 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rucmUoiu_s0ReCL0VgWWvA__original/img/edxaV55r8fJ7Th3_eWocn7nu_ik=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic635175.jpg', '2023-11-28 14:31:50', '2023-11-28 14:31:50');

Play will continue clockwise.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;A turn consists of two phases:&#10;1) Growth&#10;Some circles have a set of numbers in them. The first number is the amount of parasite chips that grow every turn. If you have at least one chip in the circle, you will add this number of chips to the circle. If you do not have enough chips of your color, you may choose where to grow. The maximum number of chips a single player may have on the board is 50. The second number is the maximum amount of parasites this circle can support. If you begin the turn beneath the maximum, you may grow to the maximum number. If you begin the turn above the maximum, your parasites are strangled and you LOSE the amount of chips you would have gained (down to the maximum, but not below). &#10;Examples:&#10;&#10;     Parasite Influidia has 3 chips on a circle with +3/15. This turn Influidia gains 3 chips to be at 6.&#10;     Parasite Betonium has 16 chips on a circle with +2/10.

Parasites may move across one black line connecting two circles. Parasites may only move one circle per turn. All parasites must move in stacks of a maximum of 5. You may split your parasites into smaller stacks at any time. The unnumbered circles may only have one stack inside at a time (so a maximum of a 5). Any parasites inside of an  unnumbered circle MUST MOVE this turn or lose one chip. Any parasite moving into a circle occupied by another player begins combat. Combat When one player's parasites moves onto another player's  parasites, they fight. Each attacking parasite kills one defending parasite by sacrificing itself. If the attacking player has more parasites, the remainder now occupy the circle. If the defending player has more parasites, any that are left remain on the circle. If both players have the same number of parasites, all are destroyed and the circle is left empty.&#10;&#10;Elimination / Winning&#10;If at any time a player has no more parasites on the board, they are eliminated.

Even so, its outcome was very important for the whole world, as it settled the overall course of Poland until 1939, including opposition both to the Third Reich, as well as USRR.&#10;&#10;What started as an officers' demonstration led by First Marshall J&oacute;zef Pi&#197;&#130;sudski against the unpopular center-right government rapidly expanded into an unsuccesful coup d'&eacute;tat and ended as a short, albeit intensive quasi-revolutionary civil war. It put Poland at the brink of revolution and annihilation.&#10;&#10;It is a rare example of an unsuccessful coup followed by a successful civil war.&#10;&#10;&quot;Przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; had a very special climate. At the beginning it was partly a traditional &quot;szlachta&quot; foray (polish: &quot;zajazd&quot;), partly a political demonstration, with all of the 18th century &quot;honorable war&quot; traditions (including dueling officers and shooting above opponents' heads).&#10;&#10;Unfortunately in a few days it fall into an abyss of bloody total civil war, with mass use in the center of Warsaw of tanks, armored trains, heavy artillery and aerial bombardments; with general strike, assassinating, sniping, and execution of prisoners as well as masses of civilian combatants, on both sides. It was really close to use of gas warfare.&#10;&#10;The game &quot;Maj 1926&quot; (name may change) depicts those days in an innovative way: a card-driven euro-wargame.&#10;&#10;Occupying areas in Warsaw (like the Citadel, telephone center, Prime Minister chancellery, Ministry of Railroad, Ministry of Defense, hospitals, supply depots; also railroad, power, gas and water stations) brings advantages (bonuses to combat, movement, logistics, politics, and many more, including variable phase order). Usually it is necessary to leave a unit to fully exploit such areas (a kind of worker placement).&#10;&#10;Oddities of this conflict (such as a lack of fog of war, fluent dynamics of aggression, a big influence of politics over the course of battle) as well as all &quot;what-if&quot;s (like foreign intervention) are well represented in the mechanisms.&#10;&#10;If you want to make successful coup in Poland (or defend the legal government) and you know the Polish language, it is a game for you.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately the author doesn't anticipate an international version (other than translating the manual and all cards into a BGG file), as &quot;przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot; is a kind of event understandable only by Poles.&#10;&#10;Polish site about this game:&#10;http://www.strategie.net.pl/viewforum.php?f=161&amp;sid=0239f37ae2c3e623e339d6505c118971&#10;&#10;Photos about this game:&#10;http://umpapa.multiply.com/photos/album/26#&#10;&#10;The game was to be published in 2011, on the 85th anniversary of &quot;przewr&oacute;t majowy&quot;.

Each square is marked at one of the  corners to help identify related squares during a complex move.&#10;&#10;The game begins in a unique way: &#10;The players agree on how many pawns each side will have.  An empty board is placed between the players and the pawns are placed in front of the players, but not on the board.

A pawn that is not frozen has the potential to make a jumping or non-jumping move in any direction.

The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.&#10;&#10;Playing time for &ldquo;Desert War Egypt&rdquo; as averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 8 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.&#10;&#10;Each game of Desert War Egypt includes full box, rules, one sheet of large 5/8&rdquo; die cut thick counters, dice, two decks of 10 cards, and a thick card stock game board.&#10;&#10;According to the back of the box, the game will include new and updated counters for MedWar Sicily, the first game using this system.
